       "        '\\nA novel respiratory virus that originated in Wuhan, China, last December has spread to six continents. Hundreds of thousands have been infected, at least 20,000 people have died and the spread of the coronavirus was called a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March.\\nMuch remains unknown about the virus, including how many people may have very mild or asymptomatic infections, and whether they can transmit the virus. The precise dimensions of the outbreak are hard to know.\\nHere’s what scientists have learned so far about the virus and the outbreak.What is a coronavirus?\\nCoronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their surfaces, resembling a crown or the sun’s corona. They can infect both animals and people, and can cause illnesses of the respiratory tract.\\nAt least four types of coronaviruses cause very mild infections every year, like the common cold. Most people get infected with one or more of these viruses at some point in their lives.\\nAnother coronavirus that circulated in China in 2003 caused a more dangerous condition known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. The virus was contained after it had sickened 8,098 people and killed 774.\\nMiddle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, is also caused by a coronavirus.\\nThe new virus has been named SARS-CoV-2. The disease it causes is called Covid-19. How dangerous is it?It is hard to accurately assess the lethality of a new virus. It appears to be less often fatal than the coronaviruses that caused SARS or MERS, but significantly more so than the seasonal flu. The fatality rate was over 2 percent, in one study. But government scientists have estimated that the real figure could be below 1 percent, roughly the rate occurring in a severe flu season.\\nAbout 5 percent of the patients who were hospitalized in China had critical illnesses. Children seem less likely to be infected with the new coronavirus, while middle-aged and older adults are disproportionately infected.\\nMen are more likely to die from an infection compared to women, possibly because they produce weaker immune responses and have higher rates of tobacco consumption, Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure than women, which may increase the risk of complications following an infection.\\n“This is a pattern we’ve seen with many viral infections of the respiratory tract — men can have worse outcomes,” said Sabra Klein, a scientist who studies sex differences in viral infections and vaccination responses at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\\nHow is the new coronavirus transmitted?Experts believe that an infected animal may have first transmitted the virus to humans at a market that sold live fish, animals and birds in Wuhan. The market was later shut down and disinfected, making it nearly impossible to investigate which animal may have been the exact origin.\\nBats are considered a possible source, because they have evolved to coexist with many viruses, and they were found to be the starting point for SARS. It is also possible that bats transmitted the virus to an intermediate animal, such as pangolins, which are consumed as a delicacy in parts of China, and may have then passed on the virus to humans.\\nThe outbreak grew because of human-to-human transmission.\\nPeople infected with the virus produce tiny respiratory droplets when they breathe, talk, cough or sneeze, allowing the virus to travel through the air.\\nMost respiratory droplets fall to the ground within a few feet. People who are in close contact with those infected, particularly family members and health care workers, may catch the virus this way.\\nScientists don’t know how long the new coronavirus can live on surfaces, and preliminary research suggests that hot and humid environments may not slow down the pathogen’s spread. Warm weather does tend to inhibit influenza and milder coronaviruses.\\nInfected people may be able to pass on the new coronavirus even if they have few obvious symptoms, a study in Germany has found. That’s “bad news,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an expert in infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.\\nWhen people don’t know they are infected, “they’re up and about, going to work or the gym or to religious services, and breathing on or near other people,” he said. Still, a report by the World Health Organization suggests that asymptomatic cases are rare.\\n\\nWhat symptoms should I look out for?Symptoms of this infection include fever, cough and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. The illness causes lung lesions and pneumonia. But milder cases may resemble the flu or a bad cold, making detection difficult.\\nPatients may exhibit other symptoms, too, such as gastrointestinal problems or diarrhea. Current estimates suggest that symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after being exposed to the virus.\\nIf you have a fever or a cough and recently visited China, South Korea, Italy or another place with a known coronavirus outbreak, or spent time with someone who did, see your health care provider. Call first, so the office can prepare for your visit and take steps to protect other patients and staff from potential exposure.\\nIs there a test for the virus? What is the treatment? There is a diagnostic test that can determine if you are infected. It was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based on genetic information about the virus provided by the Chinese authorities.\\nIn early February, the C.D.C. sent diagnostic test kits to 200 state laboratories, but some of the kits were flawed and recalled. Now other laboratories are making their own tests. Other countries are using test kits manufactured locally or sent out by the W.H.O.\\nThe C.D.C. announced that anyone who wanted to be tested could, if a doctor approves the request. Private companies, such as LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics, are also rushing to provide tests at various labs across the country, but the supply has yet to meet public demand. Many patients complain that they still cannot get tested.\\n\\nOnce a coronavirus infection is confirmed, the treatment is mainly supportive,  making sure the patient is getting enough oxygen, managing his or her fever and using a ventilator to push air into the lungs if necessary, said Dr. Julie Vaishampayan, chairwoman of the public health committee at the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\\nPatients with mild cases are told to rest and drink plenty of fluids “while the immune system does its job and heals itself,” she said. Most people with mild infections recover in about two weeks. More than half of those who have been infected globally have already  recovered.\\nA number of drugs are currently being tested as potential treatments, including  an antiviral medication called remdesivir, which appears to be effective in animals and was used to treat the first American patient in Washington State. The National Institutes of Health is testing the drug on infected patient in a clinical trial in Nebraska. The drug’s maker, Gilead, has also begun trials at various sites in Asia.\\nHow long will it take to develop a vaccine?A coronavirus vaccine is still months away — and perhaps years. While new technology, advancements in genomics and improved global coordination have allowed researchers to act quickly, vaccine development remains an expensive and risky process.\\nAfter the SARS outbreak in 2003, it took researchers about 20 months to get a vaccine ready for human trials. (The vaccine was never needed, because the disease was eventually contained.)\\nBy the time of the Zika outbreak in 2015, researchers had brought the vaccine development timeline down to six months.\\nNow, they hope that work from past outbreaks will help cut the timeline further. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health and several companies are working on vaccine candidates.\\nDr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said a preliminary clinical trial might get off the ground in as little as three months. But researchers would still need to conduct extensive testing to prove a vaccine was safe and effective.\\nHow can I protect myself?The best thing you can do to avoid getting infected is to follow the same general guidelines that experts recommend during flu season, because the coronavirus spreads in much the same way. Wash your hands frequently throughout the day. Avoid touching your face, and maintain a distance — at least six feet — from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.\\nThe risk of infection with the new coronavirus in the United States “is way too low for the general public to start wearing a face mask,” said Dr. Peter Rabinowitz, co-director of the University of Washington MetaCenter for Pandemic Preparedness and Global Health Security.\\nBut, he added, “if you have symptoms of a respiratory illness, wearing a mask reduces the risk of infecting others.”\\nShould I cancel my international travel plans?Many countries have also enacted travel restrictions and bans, closing their doors to people from countries with sustained transmission of the virus. Governments around the world have been screening incoming passengers for signs of illness.\\nIs it too late to contain the virus? W.H.O. officials have credited lockdown measures China imposed in late January for averting the spread of more cases from Wuhan. China sealed off cities, shut down businesses and schools, and ordered residents to remain in their homes. Officials use cellphone data to track and intercept those who have been to Hubei Province.\\nIn recent weeks, government workers have gone door-to-door to round up people who are infected, placing them in stadiums and other buildings that have been converted to makeshift hospitals. Now, official reports suggest that new cases in China are waning.\\nBut there is growing fear that containment may no longer be possible. Clarence Tam, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at the School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore, said the surge of cases in multiple countries was “concerning because we know the transmissions are spreading at a fast rate.”\\n“We’ve learned some things of this new virus for the past couple of weeks that make it seem unlikely that containment will be a strategy that will completely stop this virus,” he added.\\nThere is benefit to delaying its spread as long as possible. Containing the virus may buy health officials more time to stock hospitals with test kits and respirators, and for local governments, companies and schools to enact strategies — telecommuting and online classes, for instance — that may reduce the spread.\\nBut the ability of nations to prepare for the arrival of coronavirus cases will depend largely on the strength of their health systems, capacity to conduct tests and effectiveness in communicating updates to the public.\\n“We have been dealing with flu for decades, and even now it seems some countries don’t even have a policy for influenza preparedness,” said Leo Poon, head of the University of Hong Kong’s public health laboratory sciences division. “Not to mention something which is new to them. That’s a problem.”\\n',\n",

       "        'Chinese Health Officials: More Die From Newly Identified Coronavirus\\n\\nChinese health authorities held a briefing Wednesday on a new coronavirus thought to have originated in Wuhan, China. More than 200 cases have been detected globally, including one case in the U.S.\\n\\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\\n\\nChina is scrambling to contain a never before seen strain of coronavirus. At least nine people have died; at least 440 are infected, and that includes 15 medical staffers. It has already made its way to six countries now, including the United States after an American was diagnosed upon his return from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus is thought to have originated. We\\'re joined by NPR\\'s Beijing correspondent Emily Feng. Hi, Emily.\\n\\nEMILY FENG, BYLINE: Hi, David.\\n\\nGREENE: So how worried is the Chinese government about this right now?\\n\\nFENG: They\\'re pretty worried, but they\\'re also being really careful. They don\\'t want to cause a panic, but they\\'re also trying to educate the public in how to protect themselves. Some top Chinese health official held a press conference today that NPR went to. Here\\'s Li Bin, China\\'s vice director of its national health commission.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)\\n\\nLI BIN: (Through interpreter) We have ensured management of export channels such as temperature checks at airports, train and bus stations and ports. And we will reduce as much as possible events with large congregations.\\n\\nFENG: But the problem is that neither - none of these people still know exactly what caused the virus. They think it came from this open-air market where wild animals were sold and eaten. But they don\\'t know what type of animal\\'s behind the virus, so that makes it really hard to prevent future outbreaks.\\n\\nGREENE: And now, I mean, this has arrived in the United States. It\\'s arrived in other countries, which is beginning to raise more alarms around the world. I mean, can you just remind me of the timeline of all this? It seems to have almost come out of nowhere.\\n\\nFENG: It\\'s really exploded over the last couple of days, and there are several theories as to why. But the first case was reported about 3 1/2 weeks ago on New Year\\'s Eve. And then the cases climbed, but they plateaued for about three weeks and stayed - and never broke, about 60 confirmed cases. It\\'s really only been in the last three days that we\\'ve this sudden jump in the number of cases in China, and you\\'ve also seen this jump in measures that authorities have taken to screen for the virus and to prevent it from spreading.\\n\\nSo as Li Bin mentioned, there are now temperature sensors set up at train stations and on airplanes. They\\'re even doing temperature checks at some hotels. But people are understandably very, very worried.\\n\\nGREENE: Do they feel like their government is doing enough in China?\\n\\nFENG: There\\'s a lot of debate online about this. There\\'s skepticism that they\\'re even being told how severe the problem is. As of today, there are more than 450 confirmed cases, but that\\'s a huge jump just in the last four days from the low numbers that were reported over the last few weeks. A London study from Imperial College there has gone viral in China, and that estimates that there should be at least 1,700 cases based on similar types of viruses that have broken out before.\\n\\nChina refutes that study. Here\\'s the director of China\\'s disease control center, Gao Fu, today responding to the study.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nGAO FU: (Through interpreter) This is a mathematical model. The number you are referring to was the maximum in the range predicted. Faced with viruses like this, facts must be facts, and theories are just theories.\\n\\nFENG: So they\\'ve been really, really strict in controlling information about the virus. They\\'ve actually even detained some people who they said were spreading rumors on social media, when these people claimed that they had relatives who\\'ve gotten sick or even died and were not reported in the official statistics.\\n\\nBut they have a reason for being suspicious. China\\'s government does have a history of deliberately underreporting outbreaks. The most recent example is just last year. There was something called African swine flu. Provincial authorities denied that the case was really severe, and that let the flu spread to other pig farms and wiped out something like 40% of the pigs in China. And then most infamously, in 2003, SARS, which ended up killing more than 800 people, but the Chinese government denied.\\n\\nGREENE: NPR\\'s Emily Feng reporting on this virus outbreak in China. She joins us this morning. Thanks so much. We appreciate it, Emily.\\n\\nFENG: Thanks, David.\\n\\n[POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In this report, we incorrectly refer to African swine flu. In fact, the disease is a virus known as African swine fever.]\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF THE PHYSICS HOUSE BAND \"TERATOLOGY\")\\n\\nCopyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

       "        'Public health experts around the globe are scrambling to understand, track, and contain a new virus that appeared in Wuhan, China, at the beginning of December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease caused by the virus COVID-19, which references the type of virus and the year it emerged. The WHO declared that the virus is a pandemic.\\n\\nThe Verge is regularly updating this page with all the latest news and analysis.\\n\\nYou can see where and how many cases of the illness have been reported in this map. The majority of the illnesses were initially in China, where the virus first emerged, but the rate of new cases there has nearly stopped. There are now many times more cases outside of China than there were inside of it at the height of the outbreak. There are large outbreaks of the disease in multiple places, including Spain, Italy, and the United States, which currently has the worst outbreak of any country in the world.\\n\\nAs this important story continues to unfold, our hope is to answer all of your questions as people work to understand this virus and contain its spread.\\n\\nTable of contents\\n\\nWhere did the virus come from?\\n\\nAt the end of December, public health officials from China informed the World Health Organization that they had a problem: an unknown, new virus was causing pneumonia-like illness in the city of Wuhan. They quickly determined that it was a coronavirus and that it was rapidly spreading through and outside of Wuhan.\\n\\nCoronaviruses are common in animals of all kinds, and they sometimes can evolve into forms that can infect humans. Since the start of the century, two other coronaviruses have jumped to humans, causing the SARS outbreak in 2002 and the MERS outbreak in 2012.\\n\\nScientists think this new virus first became capable of jumping to humans at the beginning of December. It originally seemed like the virus first infected people at a seafood market in Wuhan and spread from there. But one analysis of early cases of the illness, published on January 24th, found that the first patient to get sick did not have any contact with the market. Experts are still trying to trace the outbreak back to its source.\\n\\nThe type of animal the virus originated from is not clear, although one analysis found that the genetic sequence of the new virus is 96 percent identical to one coronavirus found in bats. Both SARS and MERS originated in bats.\\n\\nWhere is it spreading?\\n\\nThe virus is now spreading all over the world.\\n\\nAlthough it originated in China, the country took aggressive action at the start of the outbreak, shutting down transportation in some cities and suspending public gatherings. Officials isolated sick people and aggressively tracked their contacts, and had a dedicated network of hospitals to test for the virus.\\n\\nNow, the epicenter of the pandemic is in the US, which has more cases than any country in the world. New York City has the highest number of cases in the country. Previous US hot spots included a nursing home in Washington; New Rochelle, New York; and the Boston area, where the disease spread at a conference.\\n\\nThere are over 1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the US.\\n\\nHow dangerous is this new virus?\\n\\nIt takes information about both how severe an illness is and how easily it can spread to determine how “bad” it can be. Epidemiologists often use this tool to assess new strains of the flu, for example:\\n\\nIf an illness isn’t very severe (and kills only a small percentage of people), but it’s highly transmissible, it can still be devastating. An easily transmitted illness that kills a small percentage of the people it infects can still cause a lot of deaths, precisely because so many people get sick.\\n\\nThe WHO named the illness caused by the coronavirus COVID-19 — “co” and “vi” for coronavirus, “d” for disease, and “19” for the year when the disease emerged.\\n\\nCOVID-19 is a serious illness, and it’s much more dangerous than the flu. One Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) projection suggests that between 160 to 214 million people will be infected in the US, and that between 200,000 and 1.7 million could die. That doesn’t take into account actions taken to slow down the outbreak, though.\\n\\nThe symptoms of COVID-19 have ranged from mild, like those in a cold, to severe. Around 80 percent of confirmed cases are mild and don’t require hospitalization — at least, 80 percent of the cases that we know about. It’s still possible that there are more mild cases of the illness that haven’t been flagged, which would shrink the percentage of cases that are severe. In about 15 percent of people, the illness is severe enough that they need to be hospitalized, and about 5 percent of cases are critical. It appears around half of the people with critical cases of the illness die from it.\\n\\nSo far, experts say that around 1 percent of people who get sick with COVID-19 will die, though it’s too early to say for sure how often it is fatal. Those numbers may change as the outbreak progresses, and will be different in different places, depending on the demographics of the population. By comparison, 14 to 15 percent of people who got sick from SARS died.\\n\\nDifferent groups of people, though, are more at risk of having a severe case of the illness or of dying from it. Most deaths in this outbreak have been in older people and those who have underlying health issues, like heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes. In that group, people are more at risk of dying. Around 14 percent of people over the age of 80 who get sick will die, for example.\\n\\nHow easily can the virus spread?\\n\\nThe virus moves rapidly. The new coronavirus spreads quickly in contained environments, like on the Diamond Princess cruise ship.\\n\\nEarly evidence suggested that, like other coronaviruses, the virus jumps between people who are in very close contact with each other. It also probably spreads when an infected person sneezes or coughs. Coughs and sneezes produce little droplets of mucus and saliva. If these droplets make it into another person’s eyes, mouth, or nose, they can get sick. The viruses in those little droplets can also fall onto surfaces, like tables or doorknobs — if someone touches that surface and touches their eyes, mouth, or nose, they can also get sick.\\n\\nEarly research shows that the virus can linger on surfaces such as plastic and stainless steel for a few days, which is why it’s important to clean countertops, doorknobs, and other places people touch regularly. The virus doesn’t appear to stay infectious on cardboard for longer than a day, so packages should be fairly safe.\\n\\nScientists are still trying to figure out how long tiny droplets containing virus could linger in the air if a sick person coughs or sneezes, or when they breathe or talk. They know that certain procedures done in the hospital can spray the virus into the air, where it can linger for a few hours, which is why it’s so important for doctors and nurses doing those procedures to have masks that can filter it out. But it’s still not clear how much the virus stays in the air normally without those artificial interventions.\\n\\nWe also don’t know when people with COVID-19 become contagious or how long being contagious lasts. One study of nine people in Germany with mild cases of the illness found that they had high levels of the virus in their throats early on in the course of the disease, before they felt very sick. Research out of China showed that people without symptoms still have high levels of the virus in their throats and noses, so they may be passing it along if they cough or sneeze.\\n\\nThe WHO says that people appear to be able to spread the virus for up to three days before they start showing symptoms, and preliminary research suggests that people without symptoms or mild, almost unnoticeable symptoms may be driving the epidemic. At a nursing home in Washington state, 13 of 23 people who tested positive for the virus at one point did not yet have symptoms.\\n\\nEach sick person will go on to infect, on average, between 1.4 and 2.5 additional people, the WHO says, though that’s an early estimate. Other teams of researchers have published their own estimates, with most saying a sick person will infect an average of around two or three people.\\n\\nThose numbers are called the virus’s R0 (pronounced “R-naught”). The R0 is the mathematical representation of how well an infection might be able to spread. The higher the number, the easier the disease is to spread. For comparison, the R0 for SARS was between two and five. But that doesn’t mean each sick person will actually infect that many people; quarantines and other actions taken to control outbreaks of a virus can bring down the number of people a sick person infects.\\n\\nCan we treat this virus?\\n\\nThere aren’t any proven treatments for COVID-19, but there are dozens of studies underway to find some. One leading candidate is remdesivir, an antiviral medication originally developed to treat Ebola. There are clinical trials testing it in patients in China, in the US, and around the world. While there’s a lot of hype around the anti-malaria medication chloroquine, there’s still no evidence it — or any other drug — actually works.\\n\\nResearch teams and pharmaceutical companies are also working to develop a vaccine that can protect people from infection. However, vaccine development takes a long time. Even if everything goes smoothly, it will be around a year to 18 months before one is available, said Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\\n\\nWhat can I do to protect myself and others?\\n\\nStay home as much as possible, especially if you’re feeling sick. Stay home even if you’re not feeling sick — evidence suggests people can be contagious even if they don’t have symptoms. Wash your hands, wipe down surfaces with disinfectant, and cover your mouth if you cough.\\n\\nYou can also wear cloth masks or face coverings when you’re out in public, especially in places where it’s hard to stay far away from others. Don’t go out and buy medical-grade masks because doctors and nurses need those. But wearing a cloth face covering could help stop you virus-laden particles to other people, even if you don’t know you’re sick.\\n\\nIf you’re a young, healthy person, you might not feel very sick if you catch COVID-19. But if you don’t stay home and away from others, you could pass it on to someone older or with a chronic health condition who is more likely to have a severe case of the disease.\\n\\nOne of the best ways to slow the spread of an outbreak is by staying away from other people, which is also called “social distancing.” That gives a virus less opportunity to jump from person to person. It’s why everyone is being asked to stay home. Those measures help blunt the impact of an outbreak by slowing the virus. If fewer people get sick at once, it’s easier for health care providers to give everyone good care.\\n\\nIf I already had COVID-19, am I immune?\\n\\nMany researchers think that after someone is infected with the coronavirus, there’s a good chance that person won’t get sick from the virus again for some still-undetermined amount of time. That’s based on what scientists know about how most viruses work. Usually, when you’re sick from a viral infection, your body develops antibodies against that virus. The next time you’re exposed to the virus, those antibodies could stop it from turning into a raging illness — though that isn’t always the case.\\n\\nThere isn’t concrete evidence that people who got sick once with COVID-19 can’t get sick again because no studies have specifically tested that idea. But virologists don’t think that this virus behaves differently than most other viruses — so people who did get sick are probably protected. The question, though, is for how long: for some viruses, the protection fades after a year or a few years. There aren’t answers to that question yet.\\n\\nSome doctors in China and South Korea have reported that some patients who were sick with COVID-19 and recovered tested positive for the virus a second time. That probably doesn’t mean they were re-infected, though, and doesn’t mean that people can get sick more than once in a short period of time. Instead, it probably means that there were still tiny bits of virus lingering in their nose and throat — not enough to make them sick, and probably not enough to make other people sick, but enough to trigger a positive test. It could also mean that the patients’ initial, negative tests after they felt better were false negatives, which happen frequently.\\n\\nWhat’s happening in the US?\\n\\nUS Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar declared a public health emergency in response to the coronavirus at the end of January, and President Trump declared a federal emergency in March.\\n\\nThe virus is spreading through the country, and dozens of states and counties have made emergency declarations. Hotspots include Louisiana and New York. It may have been spreading in Washington and other states for weeks before it was first detected.\\n\\nAs the case counts shoot up, governors and local officials have closed nonessential businesses and told people to work from home and stay away from others. Hospitals in New York City and other places are buckling under the strain of hundreds of critically ill people; they’re running short on protective equipment for nurses and ventilators to help patients breathe. The interventions are helping to slow the spread of the disease in some areas.\\n\\nThe virus spread undetected because CDC guidelines originally did not allow testing unless a sick person had been in a country with an ongoing spread of the virus or who had been in contact with someone with a confirmed case of the disease could be tested. That delayed the diagnosis of patients who did not have those risk factors. They’ve since updated the guidance to say that doctors can use their best judgment to decide if the patient should be tested.\\n\\nPublic health experts are struggling to slow the spread of disease in part because there are still a limited number of tests available. It took too long for the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC to develop and distribute a functioning test, and longer still for testing capacity to increase. In addition, public health agencies across the country don’t have the resources to get in touch with everyone who tests positive and find the people they may have exposed — a critical public health tool called contact tracing.\\n\\nExperts say that the US needs to dramatically increase the number of tests done each week and scale up the contact tracing workforce in order to control the outbreak.\\n\\nThe US currently has the worst outbreak of any country in the world.',\n",

       "        '© HEATHER KHALIFA/The Philadelphia Inquirer/TNS Volunteers grab absentee ballot applications to stuff into food boxes distributed by the city, school district, and nonprofit groups in Philadelphia on May 16, 2020.\\n\\nIt’s a familiar election night routine: Polls close, and everyone wants to know who won — immediately. Every minute matters for Americans anxiously awaiting the results. News organizations race to meet the demand by using complex statistical models to “call\" the winner long before all the votes are counted.\\n\\nBut get comfortable waiting: Instant electoral gratification is about to become a thing of the past.\\n\\nA new Pennsylvania law that allows any voter to cast a ballot by mail, along with a surge in requests for mail-in ballots driven by fears of voting in person during the coronavirus pandemic, has set up a 2020 election in which everyone could be left waiting for days before results are known.\\n\\nThat might not bother the public much when it comes to the June 2 primary, with a Democratic presidential contest that has already been effectively decided. But when President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden face off in the fall, and all eyes turn to the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, delays could effectively leave the race for the White House in limbo for days.\\n\\n“If nothing changes before November, I would bet my house there would be no way anybody could responsibly call the presidential race [on election night],” said Forrest Lehman, elections director for Lycoming County, in central Pennsylvania.\\n\\nThe new law, which also changes how and when mail-in votes are counted, already stood to wreak havoc on the public’s expectation for quick results.\\n\\n“No county wants to be the reason we don’t know the leader of the free world on election night,” Lee Soltysiak, Montgomery County’s chief operating officer and clerk of its election board, said in January. “And that’s the position, depending on the margin, we’re all likely to be in.”\\n\\nRead our January story: Pennsylvania’s presidential election could be too close to call for days because of a new lawThen the coronavirus hit. The number of polling places are being cut. Requests for mail ballots have gone through the roof.\\n\\nSoltysiak laughed when reminded of what he said in January.\\n\\n“We’re not in a better place,” he said this week. “All of the challenges that we’re preparing to face still exist — and we have layered on top of them those that go along with volume and the pandemic.”\\n\\nEvery election night, news outlets try to project winners using unofficial results from precincts, surveys of voters leaving polling places, turnout data, and more. (Official results aren’t certified until weeks later.)\\n\\nBut some of that modeling depends on people voting in person, and data from past elections will be less useful this year now that Pennsylvania has changed how they are run. Not to mention that voter behavior is harder to predict during a pandemic. The crisis also means it will take even longer than expected to count mail ballots, county elections officials said.\\n\\nPhiladelphia elections officials, for example, expect mail ballots to make up a majority of the vote, and they won’t even start counting them until the day after the election. Several large counties, including Bucks, Chester, and Montgomery, plan to start counting absentee ballots on election day, but expect to take at least another day or two before finishing.\\n\\nChristine Reuther, a Delaware County councilwoman, said “it would be unreasonable for people to expect results” from her county before Saturday.\\n\\nFour days after the election.\\n\\nThe only silver lining for the primary, officials said, is that Biden and Trump are all but assured to win their party nominations, which could lower turnout and the number of mail ballots to count.\\n\\nBut that might also obscure the magnitude of the problem looming in November, when millions will anxiously await the results from Pennsylvania.\\n\\n“We don’t have any choice at this point but to take our lumps on June 2 and then learn lessons from it and apply them forward,” Lehman said.\\n\\n“That’s the only hope I have,” he added. “But I don’t have a whole lot of it.”\\n\\nThe new waiting game\\n\\nThe time it takes to count ballots isn’t a sign of fraud, corruption, or any other failure of the electoral system. Rather, it’s a direct result of reforms to help expand access to voting.\\n\\nIn the past, the vast majority of votes were cast in person. Pennsylvania had one of the most restrictive absentee voting systems in the country, and only about 5% of votes in any election were cast by mail. So when polling places sent results back to county elections offices, they accounted for almost all the votes.\\n\\nThe new law enacted last year changes that.\\n\\nIt was a bipartisan move to make voting more flexible and convenient. It will also dramatically increase the number of mail ballots. (Due to a quirk in the law, Pennsylvania technically has two kinds of mail ballots, “absentee” and “mail-in,” that are functionally the same for voters.)\\n\\nPhilly will have way fewer polling places for next month’s primary because of coronavirus. Find yours here.Mail ballots also take much longer to count than in-person votes. Physical voting machines keep track of votes as they are cast and spit out a summary at the end of the night. But mail ballots require opening two different envelopes and then scanning the paper ballots. And some ballots need to be counted by hand, either due to voter error or problems with scanners.\\n\\n“It will definitely not be same-night election results that people are used to. We will certainly be well into the next day,\" said Gail Humphrey, the chief clerk for Bucks County. “Those scanners can jam.”\\n\\n“If there’s absolutely nothing that happens by technology that we didn’t foresee,” she said, “we’ll still be at least, bare minimum, into the next day still counting.”\\n\\nCoronavirus adds to the challenge\\n\\nThe pandemic led to a volume of mail ballot requests that is far exceeding officials’ expectations. As of Wednesday, Pennsylvania voters had sent in almost 1.6 million applications for mail ballots, far exceeding the total of 107,000 in the 2016 primary.\\n\\nThat means a significant strain on counties to actually tally them, just as social distancing guidelines make gathering workers to do so that much harder.\\n\\n“The number of people you’re going to have being able to canvass, or to open up envelopes even, at an eight-foot table is pretty much one. And one at the next table,” said Randall O. Wenger, chief clerk of the Lancaster County Board of Elections. “It’s going to impact and slow down that process as well.”\\n\\n“I don’t have any delusion that we’re going to have [all the ballots] opened and scanned and adjudicated that same day,\" Wenger said. \"Not going to happen.”\\n\\nPhilly voters have requested more mail ballots than all of Pennsylvania did in 2016Counties also have to figure out how many people they can even dedicate to counting ballots, given how messy in-person voting at polling places is likely to be. In Philadelphia, which will have 77% fewer polling places this year, elections staff will be too busy to count mail ballots, said Lisa Deeley, chair of the City Commissioners, who run elections.\\n\\n“It’s unrealistic to think I’m going to have people to go sit and count ballots,” she said. “Election day is going to be quite the challenge, and it’s going to pretty much take up all our bandwidth on election day.”\\n\\nThings could be even worse in November, officials said. It remains to be seen if the outbreak will have eased by then, or if it will be spiking anew. What is certain, though, is that the volume of mail ballots will be much higher because of higher turnout for the general election. And the presidential election in Pennsylvania will likely be decided by razor-thin margins, after Trump won by less than 1% of the votes cast in 2016.\\n\\nHow to fix the problem\\n\\nThere are two ways to lessen the waiting time, elections officials said: Start counting earlier and reduce the time it takes.\\n\\nReducing the processing time requires money to buy more machines and hire more staff to operate them. So starting earlier is the simpler fix.\\n\\nBut when the election law was changed last year, it required counties to wait until 8 p.m. before starting to count mail ballots.\\n\\nPennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar, who oversees elections, said at the time that she believed counties could manage the task. But pressure from the counties led state lawmakers to make a change in March: Counties can now begin counting mail ballots at 7 a.m. on election day, when polls open.\\n\\n“I’ve only got 29 precincts, it’s not going to take me days and days,” said Florence Kellett, director of elections in Wyoming County.\\n\\nKellett and officials in several other counties said they would begin counting during election day. Still, they said lawmakers should update the law again, to allow them to start counting ballots days or even weeks earlier.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, Boockvar has taken up that call.\\n\\nThe 7 a.m. change helps, “but I don’t think it’s going to be sufficient for many counties,” she told reporters Wednesday during a conference call. “I think some of the races that are close, we will get results quickly. But if there are close races, it may take a couple of days.”\\n\\nStaff writer Jonathan Tamari contributed to this article.\\n\\n———\\n\\n©2020 The Philadelphia Inquirer\\n\\nVisit The Philadelphia Inquirer at www.inquirer.com\\n\\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.',\n",

       "        'Nearly half of the Twitter accounts sharing information about the novel coronavirus are likely bots, according to researchers at Carnegie Mellon University.\\n\\nResearchers analyzed more than 200 million tweets discussing coronavirus or COVID-19 since January. They found that nearly half were sent by accounts that behave more like a convincing bot than an actual human.\\n\\nRELATED: CoronavirusNOW.com, FOX launches national hub for COVID-19 news and updates\\n\\nOf the top 50 influential retweeters, 82% were likely bots, the research showed. Out of the top 1,000 retweeters, 62% were likely bots.\\n\\nMore than 100 types of inaccurate COVID-19 stories were identified by researchers, including misinformation about potential cures and conspiracy theories — such as hospitals being filled with mannequins or the coronavirus being linked to 5G towers. Researchers said bots are also dominating conversations about ending stay-at-home orders and \"reopening America.\"\\n\\nThe team said it was too early to point to specific entities that may be behind the bots “attempting to influence online conversation.”\\n\\n\"We do know that it looks like it\\'s a propaganda machine, and it definitely matches the Russian and Chinese playbooks, but it would take a tremendous amount of resources to substantiate that,\" Kathleen Carley, a professor in the School for Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon, said in a statement.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nCarley said she and her colleagues are seeing up to two times as much bot activity as the team had predicted, based on previous natural disasters, crises and elections.\\n\\nIn this photo illustration, a Twitter logo is displayed on a smartphone with a COVID 19 sample on the background. (Photo Illustration by Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\\n\\nThe team uses multiple methods to identify which accounts are real and which are likely bots. An artificial intelligence tool analyzes account information and looks at things such as the number of followers, frequency of tweeting and an account\\'s mentions.\\n\\n\"Tweeting more frequently than is humanly possible or appearing to be in one country and then another a few hours later is indicative of a bot,\" Carley said.\\n\\n\"When we see a whole bunch of tweets at the same time or back to back, it\\'s like they\\'re timed. We also look for use of the same exact hashtag, or messaging that appears to be copied and pasted from one bot to the next,\" Carley added.\\n\\nThe team at Carnegie Mellon is continuing to monitor tweets and said posts from Facebook, Reddit and YouTube have been added to their research.\\n\\nA Twitter blog post this week from Yoel Roth, the head of site integrity, and Nick Pickles, the global public policy strategy and development director, calls the word “bot” a “loaded and often misunderstood term.”\\n\\n“People often refer to bots when describing everything from automated account activity to individuals who would prefer to be anonymous for personal or safety reasons, or avoid a photo because they’ve got strong privacy concerns,” the post states. “The term is used to mischaracterize accounts with numerical usernames that are auto-generated when your preference is taken, and more worryingly, as a tool by those in positions of political power to tarnish the views of people who may disagree with them or online public opinion that’s not favorable.”\\n\\nTwitter told NPR it has gotten rid of thousands of tweets with misleading and potentially harmful information about the coronavirus.\\n\\nIn the blog post, Twitter adds that not all forms of bots are necessarily violations of Twitter — such as customer service conversational bots that automatically find information about orders or travel reservations.\\n\\nThe company said it is proactively focusing on “platform manipulation,” which includes the malicious use of automation aimed at undermining and disrupting the public conversation, such as trying to get something to trend.\\n\\nFor someone who is unsure about an account’s authenticity, Carnegie Mellon researchers said to closely examine it for red flags. If the account is sharing links with subtle typos, many tweets are being posted in rapid succession, or a user name and profile image doesn’t seem to match up — it may be a bot.\\n\\n\"Even if someone appears to be from your community, if you don\\'t know them personally, take a closer look, and always go to authoritative or trusted sources for information,\" Carley said. \"Just be very vigilant.\"\\n\\nThis story was reported from Cincinnati.',\n",

       "        'In Brief The Facts: Major events have a lasting impact on human consciousness, and help people see what they once never saw before. This appears to be happening with the new coronavirus.\\n\\nReflect On: How do events like 9/11, and the new coronavirus impact human consciousness?\\n\\nIt’s truly an exciting time to be alive, and that’s because more and more people are “waking up” to concepts about our reality and the overall human experience that they were once previously unaware of. This has been happening for decades, but every single year it seems to amplify, and the process of our ‘awakening’ seems to accelerate rapidly.\\n\\nThis type of ‘awakening’ happens in all areas that surround human life. People learn deep truths about health and medicine, education, geopolitics, consciousness, extraterrestrials and much more. The idea that a small group of corporations and the people that run them have a strong hold on our perception, thoughts, emotions, and reactions regarding information and major world events is now far from a mere “conspiracy theory” in the eyes of many. It can be seen quite clearly, and mainstream media has been exposed as the true bearer of “fake news” by many people.\\n\\nEvents like the coronavirus simply accelerate the process of awakening, and expose mainstream media outlets for what they truly are in this moment. There’s a reason why mainstream media has such strong connections to intelligence agencies and have their roots in psychological warfare. You can find documentation and examples of that in an article I published a while ago here.\\n\\nA quote from Edward Bernays, known as the father of public relations, is powerful because it sums up these thoughts quite well:\\n\\nThe conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of.\\n\\nCurrent Events & Collective Consciousness\\n\\nWhen 9/11 happened, we were told that terrorists attacked the World Trade Centre. As the months and years went on, more and more people grew suspicious of their government’s explanation of what happened that day, this included many politicians and academics as well, further adding fuel to the fire. Evidence came forward, science was done and whistleblowers spoke out, giving us a very clear idea that what we were told happened that day, most certainly did not. Today, many polls show that more than half of the American people alone don’t believe the official explanation of what really happened that day. Since 9/11, hundreds of millions of people have become aware of “false flag” terrorism, which is the idea that the ‘powers that be’ created these events, fund terrorism, stage them, and then use these events to justify the infiltration of another country for ulterior motives. They basically create the problem, in several different ways, and then propose the solution.\\n\\nOrganizations like Wikileaks and whistleblowers like Edward Snowden have proved, as well as explained, how events like these are used to justify a heightening national security state, one where more and more of our basic rights and freedoms are stripped from us under the guise of ‘goodwill.’\\n\\nBut these events have shifted human consciousness. People become aware of how our world truly works and functions, a process we call ‘Breaking The Illusion‘ here at CE. People begin to see that the world they think is real is actually not, and that things like corruption exist within the geopolitical realm, an important realization if you wish to reflect on whether our political process truly serves us or not. This then changes the perception of people around the world, causing us to choose new paths and actions as to how to live our lives in society. Paths that would not change if we never ‘broke the illusion.’\\n\\nAnother major event is happening right now, the COVID-19 pandemic. When it comes to COVID-19, what has many people asking questions is the ban and censorship of information. For example, YouTube is now actively banning any content that contradicts anything that the World Health Organization (WHO) states with regards to the new coronavirus. Vimeo recently banned a documentary exposing “Big Pharma’s” influence within the WHO. These blatant forms of censorship have some upset, but many others see it as an eyebrow-raising moment, showing quite clearly the corruption that exists in our world and the efforts that are put forth to control the perception of the masses. We then begin to ask why?\\n\\nControlling information and what people think is important if you wish to control their lives. This is why ‘Breaking The Illusion’ is one of the first steps in the CE formula to shift consciousness. After all, why do you think people like Julian Assange are in jail, and people like Edward Snowden are living in exile?\\n\\nHow far have we sunk if telling the truth becomes a crime? How far have we sunk if we prosecute people that expose war crimes for exposing war crimes? How far have we sunk when we no longer prosecute our own war criminals? Because we identify more with them, than we identify with their people that actually expose these crimes. What does that tell about us and about our governments? In a democracy, the power does not belong to the government, but to the people. But the people have to claim it. Secrecy disempowers the people because it prevents them from exercising democratic control, which is precisely why governments want secrecy. Nils Melzer (source)\\n\\nWith COVID-19, we are also seeing a large number of people questioning the measures that multiple governments have taken to lockdown countries. We are seeing people question the information that’s being put out by our federal health agencies, including the World Health Organization. We have seen a number of scientists in the field, as well as doctors, also question the official narratives, and we have seen people like Edward Snowden, and many more, explain how this ‘pandemic’ is being used for ulterior motives. You can access those articles at the end of this article if you’re interested.\\n\\nI’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, we are now living in a time where a digital authoritarian ‘fact checker’ is patrolling the internet and censoring content it deems as ‘false.’ It does not matter if the information is true or false, backed by science or not, or whether it’s simply an opinion, if it doesn’t align with the mainstream narrative, you are not meant to see it or trust it. Should people not have the right to examine information, check sources, decide for themselves what is real and what is fake?\\n\\nThe Takeaway\\n\\nCOVID-19 has simply accelerated the process of awakening, and it’s also made even more people aware of the censorship of information that’s taking place. Along with the censorship of information, comes ridicule, and bashing by mainstream media in order to oppose and instantaneously shut down any opposite narrative.\\n\\nNarratives that go against mainstream media narratives are not acknowledged or countered, they are simply ridiculed and deemed a “conspiracy theory.”\\n\\nThe point is, events like this serve the collective. They wake us up, they help us see, they help shift the perceptions about our world and our world ‘leaders’ and serve as a catalyst for more people to start asking questions, and to see that what we are told is not always what is. This is why events as such, although hard in many senses, and real in many ways, do indeed move humanity forward in a ‘positive’ direction. What’s happening now is not a tragedy, it’s exciting, and it’s not as bad as they’ve made it out to be. But again, you can go into that type of discussion and many more, in the articles below.\\n\\nLeading Scientist Claims Lockdown & Quarantine is a “Human Catastrophe” (New Interview)\\n\\nVitamin C For COVID-19: Critical Care Medicine Hospital Chief In Wuhan Provides Updates\\n\\nTwo Emergency Medicine Doctors On Why Quarantine “Just Doesn’t Make Sense”\\n\\nIf You Die of a Clear Alternative Cause, It’s Still Listed As A COVID Death” – Dr. Ngozi Ezike\\n\\nVimeo Bans Documentary Exposing “Big Pharma’s” Influence Within The World Health Organization\\n\\nWikileaks Highlights The Influence “Big Pharma” Has On The World Health Organization\\n\\nNew Study: The Flu Vaccine Is “Significantly Associated” With An Increased Risk of Coronavirus\\n\\nBill Gates’ Latest Instagram Post Has Been Bombarded With Accusations & Comments Against Vaccines\\n\\nRenowned Microbiology Specialist On Why He Believes Coronavirus Measures Are “Draconian” (Video)\\n\\nRenowned German Pulmonologist Questions Coronavirus Measures & If They’re Necessary (Video)\\n\\nUpdates On The New Coronavirus Vaccine – Are You Going To Take It?

HealthCOVID-19CoronavirusBy AFP Saturday 14 March 2020, 11:30AM The true danger of coronavirus is unlikely to be the death toll, as experts say health systems could easily become overwhelmed by the number of cases requiring hospitalisation. Photo: AFP Mortality COVID-19, the illness caused by coronavirus, proves deadly in around 3.5% of confirmed cases. While this is not the same as its mortality rate, given many people may be infected but not realise it, it is significantly higher than seasonal flu, which typically kills 0.1% of patients. â\\x80\\x9cThere is still considerable uncertainty around the fatality rates of COVID-19 and it likely varies depending on the quality of local healthcare,â\\x80\\x9d said Francois Balloux, Professor of Computational Systems Biology at University College London. â\\x80\\x9cThat said, it is around 2% on average, which is about 20 times higher than for the seasonal flu lineages currently in circulation.â\\x80\\x9d Serious cases But the true danger of coronavirus is unlikely to be the death toll. Experts say health systems could easily become overwhelmed by the number of cases requiring hospitalisation â\\x80\\x93 and, often ventilation to support breathing. An analysis of 45,000 confirmed cases in China, where the epidemic originated, show that the vast majority of deaths were among the elderly (14.8% mortality among over 80s). But another Chinese study showed that 41% of serious cases occurred among under 50s, compared with 27% among over 65s. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s true that if youâ\\x80\\x99re older youâ\\x80\\x99re at greater risk, but serious cases can also happen in relatively young people with no prior conditions,â\\x80\\x9d said French deputy health minister Jerome Salomon. Â\\xa0 Contagiousness Disease experts estimate that each COVID-19 sufferer infects between two to three others. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s a reproduction rate up to twice as high as seasonal flu, which typically infects 1.3 new people for each patient. Vaccine / treatment Salomon said that humans have lived with influenza for more than 100 years. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ve studied it closely,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThis new virus resembles the flu in terms of physical symptoms but there are huge differences.â\\x80\\x9d Number one is the lack of a vaccine against COVID-19, or even any treatment shown to be consistently effective. While some trials have shown promise delivering anti-retroviral drugs to serious cases, as well as some experimental therapies, their sample sizes are too small to roll out to the general population. Hundreds of researchers around the world are working frantically to find a COVID-19 vaccine, but the development process takes months and is likely too late for the current outbreak. Even if a vaccine magically appeared, getting everyone access it to it is no small order. Health authorities regularly complain that not enough people receive the flu vaccine to guarantee â\\x80\\x9cherd immunityâ\\x80\\x9d. Similarities But the new virus does share some characteristics with flu, notably the measures each one of us can personally take to slow the infection rate: Avoid shaking hands, frequently wash your hands with soap and water, avoid touching your face and wear a mask if you are sick. Such actions can limit new infections just as they can with the flu, gastro illnesses and other infectious diseases. Franceâ\\x80\\x99s health ministry says that only two in 10 people regularly wash their hands after using the bathroom. â\\x80\\x9cAnd only 42% of people cover their mouth with an elbow or tissue when they cough or sneeze,â\\x80\\x9d it added, not encouragingly. \\n * Please login to comment.

       "        \"Filed under: Stay alert, and be prepared Public health experts around the globe are scrambling to understand, track, and contain a virus that appeared in Wuhan, China, at the beginning of December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease caused by the virus COVID-19, which references the type of virus and the year it emerged. The WHO declared that the virus is a pandemic.  The Verge will update this page as new information emerges. You can also find our breakdown of what research shows about how to live in a pandemic world here.  A newsletter highlighting the COVID-19 research, developments, and stories that matter. Subscribe here! You can see where and how many cases of the illness have been reported on this map. As this important story continues to unfold, our hope is to keep you up to date as people work to understand this virus and contain its spread. Table of contents Where did the virus come from?  At the end of December, public health officials from China informed the World Health Organization that they had a problem: an unknown, new virus was causing pneumonia-like illness in the city of Wuhan. They quickly determined that it was a coronavirus and that it was rapidly spreading through and outside of Wuhan.  Coronaviruses are common in animals of all kinds, and they sometimes can evolve into forms that can infect humans. Since the start of the century, two other coronaviruses have jumped to humans, causing the SARS outbreak in 2002 and the MERS outbreak in 2012. Scientists think this new virus first became capable of jumping to humans at the beginning of December. It originally seemed like the virus first infected people at a seafood market in Wuhan and spread from there. But one analysis of early cases of the illness, published on January 24th, found that the first patient to get sick did not have any contact with the market. Experts are still trying to trace the outbreak back to its source.  The type of animal the virus originated from is not clear, although one analysis found that the genetic sequence of the new virus is 96 percent identical to one coronavirus found in bats. Both SARS and MERS originated in bats.  Where is it spreading? The virus is now spreading all over the world.  Although it originated in China, the country took aggressive action at the start of the outbreak, shutting down transportation in some cities and suspending public gatherings. Officials isolated sick people and aggressively tracked their contacts, and had a dedicated network of hospitals to test for the virus.  Countries like New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea have successfully slowed the pandemic. The US has not, and it is an epicenter of the crisis.  How dangerous is this new virus? It takes information about both how severe an illness is and how easily it can spread to determine how â\\x80\\x9cbadâ\\x80\\x9d it can be. Epidemiologists often use this tool to assess new strains of the flu, for example: If an illness isnâ\\x80\\x99t very severe (and kills only a small percentage of people), but itâ\\x80\\x99s highly transmissible, it can still be devastating. An easily transmitted illness that kills a small percentage of the people it infects can still cause a lot of deaths, precisely because so many people get sick.  The WHO named the illness caused by the coronavirus COVID-19 â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9ccoâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cviâ\\x80\\x9d for coronavirus, â\\x80\\x9cdâ\\x80\\x9d for disease, and â\\x80\\x9c19â\\x80\\x9d for the year when the disease emerged.  COVID-19 is a serious illness, and itâ\\x80\\x99s much more dangerous than the flu. One Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) projection suggests that between 160 to 214 million people will eventually be infected in the US and that between 200,000 and 1.7 million could die.  The symptoms of COVID-19 have ranged from mild, like those in a cold, to severe. Around 80 percent of confirmed cases are mild and donâ\\x80\\x99t require hospitalization â\\x80\\x94 at least, 80 percent of the cases that we know about. Itâ\\x80\\x99s still possible that there are more mild cases of the illness that havenâ\\x80\\x99t been flagged, which would shrink the percentage of cases that are severe. In about 15 percent of people, the illness is severe enough that they need to be hospitalized, and about 5 percent of cases are critical. It appears around half of the people with critical cases of the illness die from it.  â\\x80\\x9cMildâ\\x80\\x9d cases, though, can still be debilitating. Some people with the disease say they couldnâ\\x80\\x99t get out of bed for weeks. For many people, the effects of the illness linger: some people report running fevers for months or experiencing waves of fatigue that make it hard to run errands or walk up the stairs. Researchers donâ\\x80\\x99t know why symptoms last so long, even after people no longer test positive for the virus. So far, experts say that around 1 percent of people who get sick with COVID-19 will die, though itâ\\x80\\x99s still too early to say for sure how often it is fatal. In the US, around 5 percent of people with confirmed cases of the virus have died from it, but that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t account for the people who didnâ\\x80\\x99t know they were infected or who weren't able to get tested.  Different groups of people are more at risk of having a severe case of the illness or of dying from it. Most deaths in this outbreak have been in older people and those who have underlying health issues, like heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes. In that group, people are more at risk of dying. Around 14 percent of people over the age of 80 who get sick will die, for example.  How easily can the virus spread? The virus moves rapidly. The new coronavirus spreads quickly in contained environments, like on the Diamond Princess cruise ship.  Early evidence suggested that, like other coronaviruses, the virus jumps between people who are in very close contact with each other. It also probably spreads when an infected person sneezes or coughs. Coughs and sneezes produce little droplets of mucus and saliva. If these droplets make it into another personâ\\x80\\x99s eyes, mouth, or nose, they can get sick. The viruses in those little droplets can also fall onto surfaces, like tables or doorknobs â\\x80\\x94 if someone touches that surface and touches their eyes, mouth, or nose, they can also get sick.  The smallest of those droplets can also linger in the air after a sick person coughs or sneezes or when they breathe and talk. People can probably get infected by those clouds of lingering droplets, even though scientists still donâ\\x80\\x99t know how often that actually happens. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s why being inside, particularly in poorly ventilated rooms, is dangerous: tiny virus-carrying droplets wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t circulate out in the same way they would outdoors.  We also donâ\\x80\\x99t know when people with COVID-19 become contagious or how long being contagious lasts. One study of nine people in Germany with mild cases of the illness found that they had high levels of the virus in their throats early on in the course of the disease before they felt very sick. Research out of China showed that people without symptoms still have high levels of the virus in their throats and noses. Itâ\\x80\\x99s probably possible for people to spread the virus to others before they feel sick. Itâ\\x80\\x99s also possible that people who never feel sick and are truly asymptomatic can infect other people. Researchers still donâ\\x80\\x99t know how often those people actually end up spreading the disease. Some studies suggest that people who do have symptoms are much more likely to spread the virus to others.  Each sick person will go on to infect, on average, between 1.4 and 2.5 additional people, the WHO says, though thatâ\\x80\\x99s an early estimate. Other teams of researchers have published their own estimates, with most saying a sick person will infect an average of around two or three people.  Those numbers are called the virusâ\\x80\\x99s R0 (pronounced â\\x80\\x9cR-naughtâ\\x80\\x9d). The R0 is the mathematical representation of how well an infection might be able to spread. The higher the number, the easier the disease is to spread. For comparison, the R0 for SARS was between two and five. But that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t mean each sick person will actually infect that many people; quarantines and other actions taken to control outbreaks of a virus can bring down the number of people a sick person infects. The R0 is also just an average. Researchers think this particular illness happens in clusters and tends to cause â\\x80\\x9csuperspreadingâ\\x80\\x9d events. Some estimate that as few as 10 percent of COVID-19 cases are responsible for 80 percent of the diseaseâ\\x80\\x99s spread â\\x80\\x94 that is, most people donâ\\x80\\x99t infect anyone else, and a few people set off chain reactions that infect dozens.  Can we treat this virus?  Since the start of the pandemic, doctors have gotten better at treating patients with COVID-19 in the hospital. There still isnâ\\x80\\x99t much doctors can do for people with mild cases of the illness who arenâ\\x80\\x99t sick enough to be hospitalized. But trials of synthetic antibodies are underway, and they might be able to help prevent people who catch the virus from becoming seriously ill.  In October, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved remdesivir, an antiviral medication originally developed for Ebola, to treat the disease â\\x80\\x94 even though clinical trials found that it only has a limited benefit.  There was a lot of early hype around the anti-malaria medication chloroquine, but clinical trials showed that it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t actually help COVID-19 patients. Clinical trials did show, though, that a cheap steroid called dexamethasone could help people who are hospitalized with very severe cases of the disease.  Research teams and pharmaceutical companies are also working to develop a vaccine that can protect people from infection. However, vaccine development takes a long time. Even if everything goes smoothly, it will be around a year to 18 months from the start of the development process before one is available, said Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. What can I do to protect myself and others? Stay home if youâ\\x80\\x99re feeling sick, even if youâ\\x80\\x99re just a little bit under the weather. Stay home as much as possible even if youâ\\x80\\x99re not feeling sick. If you do go out, wear a cloth mask or face covering when youâ\\x80\\x99re out in public, especially in places where itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to stay far away from others. While theyâ\\x80\\x99re not perfect, a cloth face covering could help stop you from spreading virus-laden particles to other people, even if you donâ\\x80\\x99t know youâ\\x80\\x99re sick. They could also partially block the virus from reaching your nose or mouth. If everyone wears them, some studies show they could help slow the spread of the virus.  Many states are slowly starting to let restaurants, barbershops, and retail stores open, even though the disease is still spreading rapidly in some places. The CDC released guidelines on June 12th, outlining the relative risk of everyday activities and the ways people should protect themselves when they venture out to the bank or the gym.  Spending time with a few people is less risky than hanging out with a large group, and everyone should wear masks and keep at a distance, the CDC says. The risk of contracting COVID-19 (or spreading it) goes up if you spend time with other people indoors rather than outside.  Before deciding if you should do a particular activity, the agency recommends thinking about how many new cases are being reported each day in your area. If the case numbers are low, the risk is lower than if hundreds of new people are being diagnosed with COVID-19 each day. You should also think about how closely youâ\\x80\\x99d be interacting with other people (and if theyâ\\x80\\x99d be wearing a mask). If youâ\\x80\\x99re a young, healthy person, you might not feel very sick if you catch COVID-19. But you could pass it on to someone older or with a chronic health condition who is more likely to have a severe case of the disease.  If I already had COVID-19, am I immune? Many researchers think that after someone is infected with the coronavirus, thereâ\\x80\\x99s a good chance that person wonâ\\x80\\x99t get sick from the virus again for some still-undetermined amount of time. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s based on what scientists know about how most viruses work. Usually, when youâ\\x80\\x99re sick from a viral infection, your body develops antibodies against that virus. The next time youâ\\x80\\x99re exposed to the virus, those antibodies could stop it from turning into a raging illness â\\x80\\x94 though that isnâ\\x80\\x99t always the case.  There isnâ\\x80\\x99t concrete evidence that people who got sick once with COVID-19 canâ\\x80\\x99t get sick again because no studies have specifically tested that idea. But virologists donâ\\x80\\x99t think that this virus behaves differently than most other viruses â\\x80\\x94 so people who did get sick are probably protected. The question, though, is for how long: for some viruses, the protection fades after a year or a few years. There arenâ\\x80\\x99t answers to that question yet.  Whatâ\\x80\\x99s happening in the US? US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar declared a public health emergency in response to the coronavirus at the end of January, and President Trump declared a federal emergency in March.  As the overall case counts rose through March and April, governors and local officials closed nonessential businesses and told people to work from home and stay away from others. The interventions are helped to slow the spread of the disease in some areas, but many states â\\x80\\x94 including Texas, Arizona, and Florida â\\x80\\x94 lifted restrictions before public health experts thought it was safe.  Through the summer of 2020, cases in those places rapidly increased. After a long plateau, spikes in some Southern and Western US states pushed up new daily case numbers in the US. A fall surge hit the whole country, sending case numbers above the summer highs. The Midwest has the highest burden of disease, but hospitalizations are climbing all over the country.  Early in 2020, the virus spread undetected for weeks in the US. Initially, CDC guidelines did not allow testing unless a sick person had been in a country with an ongoing spread of the virus or who had been in contact with someone with a confirmed case of the disease could be tested. That delayed the diagnosis of patients who did not have those risk factors.  The US is doing around one million COVID-19 tests per day, according to data collected by volunteers at the COVID Tracking Project. Testing was slow to get off the ground in the US. It took too long for the FDA and the CDC to develop and distribute a functioning test and longer still for testing capacity to increase.

Ao abrir assembleia anual, chefe da entidade critica ainda a concentraÃ§Ã£o de 75% das vacinas contra o coronavÃ\\xadrus em naÃ§Ãµes ricas, enquanto em muitos paÃ\\xadses pobres mÃ©dicos e enfermeiros nÃ£o foram vacinados.  Para OMS, todos os profissionais de saÃºde jÃ¡ estariam vacinados se distribuiÃ§Ã£o das doses fosse mais igualitÃ¡ria Pelo menos 115.000 profissionais da saÃºde morreram devido Ã\\xa0 covid-19 em todo o mundo desde o inÃ\\xadcio da pandemia, estimou nesta segunda-feira (24/05) a OrganizaÃ§Ã£o Mundial da SaÃºde (OMS). \"Muitos foram infectados e, embora os relatÃ³rios sejam escassos, estimamos que pelo menos 115.000 profissionais de saÃºde pagaram o preÃ§o final servindo aos outros\", disse o diretor-geral daÂ\\xa0OMS, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, no inÃ\\xadcio da assembleia anual da entidade, que engloba 194 paÃ\\xadses. Tedros afirmou que nÃ£o pediria um minuto de silÃªncio Ã\\xa0s vÃ\\xadtimas, mas, em vez disso, convocou as poucas dezenas de pessoas presentes na sala com ele, bem como todos aqueles que assistem Ã\\xa0 assembleia virtualmente em capitais de todo o mundo, a agradecerem com salvas de palmas aos milhÃµes de profissionais de saÃºde do planeta. Em seu discurso, Tedros ainda criticou os paÃ\\xadses ricos por comprarem a maior parte das vacinas disponÃ\\xadveis. Segundo ele, 75% das doses estÃ£o concentradas em apenas dez paÃ\\xadses, enquanto em muitas outras naÃ§Ãµes mais pobres milhÃµes de profissionais de saÃºde ainda nÃ£o foram vacinados. \"O nÃºmero de doses administradas globalmente atÃ© agora teria sido suficiente para cobrir todos os profissionais de saÃºde e idosos se tivessem sido distribuÃ\\xaddas de forma equitativa\", afirmou. O chefe da OMSÂ\\xa0lamentou que os paÃ\\xadses que comeÃ§aram a vacinar crianÃ§as e pessoas de baixo risco estejam fazendo isso \"Ã\\xa0s custas dos trabalhadores de saÃºde e pessoas vulnerÃ¡veis â\\x80\\x8bâ\\x80\\x8bem outros paÃ\\xadses\". TedrosÂ\\xa0tambÃ©m disse que muitos mÃ©dicos se sentiram \"frustrados, desamparados e desprotegidos, com a falta de acesso a equipamentos de proteÃ§Ã£o individual e vacinas\". Ele apelou aos paÃ\\xadses mais ricos que abram mÃ£o de suas doses e pediu Ã\\xa0s autoridades de saÃºde que garantam que pelo menos 10% das pessoas em todo o mundo sejam vacinadas atÃ© setembro, e 30% atÃ© o final do ano. O diretor-geral destacou que o programa Covax Facility, com o qual a OMS e outras organizaÃ§Ãµes tentam dar acesso mais igualitÃ¡rio Ã\\xa0s vacinas, jÃ¡ distribuiu 72 milhÃµes de doses em 125 paÃ\\xadses. \"No entanto, essas doses sÃ³ foram suficientes para imunizar cerca de 1% da populaÃ§Ã£o desses paÃ\\xadses\", esclareceu Tedros. TedrosÂ\\xa0tambÃ©m alertou que, embora haja uma terceira semana consecutiva de queda de casos, a situaÃ§Ã£o mundial Ã© muito frÃ¡gil e nenhum paÃ\\xads pode dizer que estÃ¡ seguro. \"O vÃ\\xadrus estÃ¡ mudando constantemente, e isso pode tornar as ferramentas que temos ineficazes. Devemos deixar claro que a pandemia nÃ£o terminou e nÃ£o terminarÃ¡ atÃ© que a transmissÃ£o esteja sob controle em todos os paÃ\\xadses\", acrescentou. Apesar disso, ele garantiu que, atÃ© o momento, nenhuma das variantes do coronavÃ\\xadrus comprometeu as vacinas jÃ¡ existentes. Segundo Tedros, no ritmo atual, em trÃªs semanas as mortes ocorridas apenas neste ano ultrapassarÃ£o todas as registradas em 2020. Os contÃ¡gios desde o inÃ\\xadcio de 2021 jÃ¡ superam os registrados no primeiro ano da pandemia. Em uma mensagem de vÃ\\xaddeo transmitida na assembleia, a chanceler federal da Alemanha, Angela Merkel, emitiu um alerta sobre futuras pandemias, dizendo Ã\\xa0s autoridades que a comunidade cientÃ\\xadfica precisava estar mais bem preparada. \"Esta pandemia ainda nÃ£o foi superada e nÃ£o serÃ¡ a Ãºltima\", disse Merkel. Ela pediu um tratado internacionalÂ\\xa0que permita uma colaboraÃ§Ã£o mais fÃ¡cil entre os paÃ\\xadses e um sistema de alerta mais rÃ¡pido para impedir uma eventual prÃ³xima pandemia. Ao todo, mais de 167Â\\xa0milhÃµes de pessoas contraÃ\\xadram o coronavÃ\\xadrus no mundo, e 3,46Â\\xa0milhÃµesÂ\\xa0morreram em decorrÃªncia da doenÃ§a desde o inÃ\\xadcio da pandemia, segundo nÃºmeros oficiais contabilizados pela Universidade Johns Hopkins, nos Estados Unidos. le (AFP, DPA) Desenvolvida pela alemÃ£ Biontech e produzida pela americana Pfizer, Ã© uma vacina de RNA mensageiro (mRNA). Seu princÃ\\xadpio Ã© fazer o prÃ³prio corpo produzir a proteÃ\\xadna do vÃ\\xadrus. Depois que o material Ã© injetado no corpo humano, ele instrui o organismo a produzir a proteÃ\\xadna, incentivando a fabricaÃ§Ã£o de anticorpos contra Sars-Cov-2. O produto exige a aplicaÃ§Ã£o de duas doses.  A tecnologia usada chama-se vetor viral recombinante, que usa um adenovÃ\\xadrus incapaz de causar doenÃ§as. No corpo humano, a vacina incentiva a produÃ§Ã£o da proteÃ\\xadna do coronavÃ\\xadrus, que o sistema imune reconhece como ameaÃ§a e destrÃ³i. Quando o Sars-Cov-2 infecta o organismo de verdade, o corpo reconhece e combate o vÃ\\xadrus. SÃ£o necessÃ¡rias duas doses. TambÃ©m usa a tecnologia de RNA mensageiro, que imita a proteÃ\\xadna spike, especÃ\\xadfica do vÃ\\xadrus Sars-CoV-2, que ajuda na invasÃ£o das cÃ©lulas humanas. A cÃ³pia nÃ£o Ã© nociva como o vÃ\\xadrus, mas desencadeia uma reaÃ§Ã£o das cÃ©lulas do sistema imune. Ela tambÃ©m deve ser aplicada em duas doses. Como todas as vacinas contra covid-19, Ã© aplicada em forma de injeÃ§Ã£o intramuscular. O produto da farmacÃªutica Janssen exige a aplicaÃ§Ã£o de apenas uma dose. Sua tecnologia Ã© baseada em vetores de um tipo de vÃ\\xadrus que causa resfriado comum. Na vacina, parte da proteÃ\\xadna das espÃ\\xadculas do vÃ\\xadrus Ã© colocada no adenovÃ\\xadrus (que Ã© o transportador). No corpo vacinado, inicia-se um processo de defesa, com a produÃ§Ã£o de anticorpos contra o invasor e a criaÃ§Ã£o de uma\"memÃ³ria\" contra o vÃ\\xadrus. Do laboratÃ³rio russo Gamaleya, Ã© uma vacina de vetor viral, que usa outros vÃ\\xadrus manipulados para serem inofensivos ao organismo, mas podem induzir o combate Ã\\xa0 covid-19. Injetados no corpo, eles entram nas cÃ©lulas e as fazem produzir e exibir essa proteÃ\\xadna. Isso alerta e aciona o sistema imune. A Sputnik usa adenovÃ\\xadrus diferentes na primeira e segunda doses, para reforÃ§ar a resposta imunolÃ³gica. A vacina da farmacÃªutica chinesa Sinovac Ã© fabricada no Brasil pelo Instituto Butantan. Sua tecnologia se baseia na manipulaÃ§Ã£o em laboratÃ³rio de cÃ©lulas humanas infectadas com Sars-Cov-2. A vacina Ã© produzida com fragmentos inativados do vÃ\\xadrus, ou seja, ele nÃ£o pode se reproduzir. Depois de receber a dose, o sistema imunolÃ³gico comeÃ§a a produzir anticorpos para combater o Sars-Cov-2.

       " 'Advertisement Supported by A respiratory virus that originated in China has infected more than 900,000 people worldwide, with at least 200,000 cases in the United States. By Knvul Sheikh and Roni Caryn Rabin A novel respiratory virus that originated in Wuhan, China, last December has spread to six continents. Hundreds of thousands have been infected, at least 20,000 people have died and the spread of the coronavirus was called a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March.  Much remains unknown about the virus, including how many people may have very mild or asymptomatic infections, and whether they can transmit the virus. The precise dimensions of the outbreak are hard to know.  Hereâ\\x80\\x99s what scientists have learned so far about the virus and the outbreak. Coronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their surfaces, resembling a crown or the sunâ\\x80\\x99s corona. They can infect both animals and people, and can cause illnesses of the respiratory tract.  At least four types of coronaviruses cause very mild infections every year, like the common cold. Most people get infected with one or more of these viruses at some point in their lives.  Another coronavirus that circulated in China in 2003 caused a more dangerous condition known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. The virus was contained after it had sickened 8,098 people and killed 774.  Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, is also caused by a coronavirus. The new virus has been named SARS-CoV-2. The disease it causes is called Covid-19.  It is hard to accurately assess the lethality of a new virus. It appears to be less often fatal than the coronaviruses that caused SARS or MERS, but significantly more so than the seasonal flu. The fatality rate was over 2 percent, in one study. But government scientists have estimated that the real figure could be below 1 percent, roughly the rate occurring in a severe flu season. About 5 percent of the patients who were hospitalized in China had critical illnesses.  Children seem less likely to be infected with the new coronavirus, while middle-aged and older adults are disproportionately infected.  Men are more likely to die from an infection compared to women, possibly because they produce weaker immune responses and have higher rates of tobacco consumption, Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure than women, which may increase the risk of complications following an infection. â\\x80\\x9cThis is a pattern weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen with many viral infections of the respiratory tract â\\x80\\x94 men can have worse outcomes,â\\x80\\x9d said Sabra Klein, a scientist who studies sex differences in viral infections and vaccination responses at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Experts believe that an infected animal may have first transmitted the virus to humans at a market that sold live fish, animals and birds in Wuhan. The market was later shut down and disinfected, making it nearly impossible to investigate which animal may have been the exact origin.  Bats are considered a possible source, because they have evolved to coexist with many viruses, and they were found to be the starting point for SARS. It is also possible that bats transmitted the virus to an intermediate animal, such as pangolins, which are consumed as a delicacy in parts of China, and may have then passed on the virus to humans.  The outbreak grew because of human-to-human transmission.  People infected with the virus produce tiny respiratory droplets when they breathe, talk, cough or sneeze, allowing the virus to travel through the air.  Most respiratory droplets fall to the ground within a few feet. People who are in close contact with those infected, particularly family members and health care workers, may catch the virus this way.  Scientists donâ\\x80\\x99t know how long the new coronavirus can live on surfaces, and preliminary research suggests that hot and humid environments may not slow down the pathogenâ\\x80\\x99s spread. Warm weather does tend to inhibit influenza and milder coronaviruses.  Infected people may be able to pass on the new coronavirus even if they have few obvious symptoms, a study in Germany has found. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cbad news,â\\x80\\x9d said Dr. William Schaffner, an expert in infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.  When people donâ\\x80\\x99t know they are infected, â\\x80\\x9ctheyâ\\x80\\x99re up and about, going to work or the gym or to religious services, and breathing on or near other people,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Still, a report by the World Health Organization suggests that asymptomatic cases are rare.   The virus has infected and killed millions of people around the world. See detailed maps and charts for each country. Symptoms of this infection include fever, cough and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. The illness causes lung lesions and pneumonia. But milder cases may resemble the flu or a bad cold, making detection difficult. Patients may exhibit other symptoms, too, such as gastrointestinal problems or diarrhea. Current estimates suggest that symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after being exposed to the virus. If you have a fever or a cough and recently visited China, South Korea, Italy or another place with a known coronavirus outbreak, or spent time with someone who did, see your health care provider. Call first, so the office can prepare for your visit and take steps to protect other patients and staff from potential exposure. There is a diagnostic test that can determine if you are infected. It was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based on genetic information about the virus provided by the Chinese authorities.  In early February, the C.D.C. sent diagnostic test kits to 200 state laboratories, but some of the kits were flawed and recalled. Now other laboratories are making their own tests. Other countries are using test kits manufactured locally or sent out by the W.H.O. The C.D.C. announced that anyone who wanted to be tested could, if a doctor approves the request. Private companies, such as LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics, are also rushing to provide tests at various labs across the country, but the supply has yet to meet public demand. Many patients complain that they still cannot get tested.   Once a coronavirus infection is confirmed, the treatment is mainly supportive, making sure the patient is getting enough oxygen, managing his or her fever and using a ventilator to push air into the lungs if necessary, said Dr. Julie Vaishampayan, chairwoman of the public health committee at the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Patients with mild cases are told to rest and drink plenty of fluids â\\x80\\x9cwhile the immune system does its job and heals itself,â\\x80\\x9d she said. Most people with mild infections recover in about two weeks. More than half of those who have been infected globally have already recovered. A number of drugs are currently being tested as potential treatments, including an antiviral medication called remdesivir, which appears to be effective in animals and was used to treat the first American patient in Washington State. The National Institutes of Health is testing the drug on infected patient in a clinical trial in Nebraska. The drugâ\\x80\\x99s maker, Gilead, has also begun trials at various sites in Asia. A coronavirus vaccine is still months away â\\x80\\x94 and perhaps years. While new technology, advancements in genomics and improved global coordination have allowed researchers to act quickly, vaccine development remains an expensive and risky process. After the SARS outbreak in 2003, it took researchers about 20 months to get a vaccine ready for human trials. (The vaccine was never needed, because the disease was eventually contained.)  By the time of the Zika outbreak in 2015, researchers had brought the vaccine development timeline down to six months. Now, they hope that work from past outbreaks will help cut the timeline further. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health and several companies are working on vaccine candidates. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said a preliminary clinical trial might get off the ground in as little as three months. But researchers would still need to conduct extensive testing to prove a vaccine was safe and effective.  The best thing you can do to avoid getting infected is to follow the same general guidelines that experts recommend during flu season, because the coronavirus spreads in much the same way. Wash your hands frequently throughout the day. Avoid touching your face, and maintain a distance â\\x80\\x94 at least six feet â\\x80\\x94 from anyone who is coughing or sneezing. The risk of infection with the new coronavirus in the United States â\\x80\\x9cis way too low for the general public to start wearing a face mask,â\\x80\\x9d said Dr. Peter Rabinowitz, co-director of the University of Washington MetaCenter for Pandemic Preparedness and Global Health Security.  But, he added, â\\x80\\x9cif you have symptoms of a respiratory illness, wearing a mask reduces the risk of infecting others.â\\x80\\x9d Many countries have also enacted travel restrictions and bans, closing their doors to people from countries with sustained transmission of the virus. Governments around the world have been screening incoming passengers for signs of illness.  W.H.O. officials have credited lockdown measures China imposed in late January for averting the spread of more cases from Wuhan. China sealed off cities, shut down businesses and schools, and ordered residents to remain in their homes. Officials use cellphone data to track and intercept those who have been to Hubei Province. In recent weeks, government workers have gone door-to-door to round up people who are infected, placing them in stadiums and other buildings that have been converted to makeshift hospitals. Now, official reports suggest that new cases in China are waning.  But there is growing fear that containment may no longer be possible.  Clarence Tam, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at the School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore, said the surge of cases in multiple countries was â\\x80\\x9cconcerning because we know the transmissions are spreading at a fast rate.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ve learned some things of this new virus for the past couple of weeks that make it seem unlikely that containment will be a strategy that will completely stop this virus,â\\x80\\x9d he added. There is benefit to delaying its spread as long as possible. Containing the virus may buy health officials more time to stock hospitals with test kits and respirators, and for local governments, companies and schools to enact strategies â\\x80\\x94 telecommuting and online classes, for instance â\\x80\\x94 that may reduce the spread. But the ability of nations to prepare for the arrival of coronavirus cases will depend largely on the strength of their health systems, capacity to conduct tests and effectiveness in communicating updates to the public. â\\x80\\x9cWe have been dealing with flu for decades, and even now it seems some countries donâ\\x80\\x99t even have a policy for influenza preparedness,â\\x80\\x9d said Leo Poon, head of the University of Hong Kongâ\\x80\\x99s public health laboratory sciences division. â\\x80\\x9cNot to mention something which is new to them. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s a problem.â\\x80\\x9d  Advertisement ',\n",

       " 'As the global coronavirus pandemic continues to impact Canadians, our society and the economy, it is critical that we stay informed with the progress being made by our scientists and medical researchers.Â\\xa0 With that in mind, TheFutureEconomy.ca asked expert Dr. Rob Annan, President and CEO of Genome Canada, to detail Canadaâ\\x80\\x99s response to this unprecedented crisis. Hear from Dr. Annan as he outlines the initial research projects being funded in Canada, the strengths of Canadaâ\\x80\\x99s research ecosystem, and the role our researchers are playing in the global fight for COVID-19 treatments and cure. The global research ecosystem can help to manage the spread of the coronavirus by using a diverse, and community-centred approach to research. Researchers must be collaborative, both nationally and internationally, and be open with their research results. This will allow for a multi-pronged attack on the coronavirus and will accelerate the development of a vaccine.  The short answer is that we have a large number of talented and committed researchers across the country who are working long hours and with great commitment and focus on developing new tests, new responses and new treatments for this. We are very well-equipped in that way.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 Canada is a world-leader when it comes to health-related genomics research.Â\\xa0ItÂ\\xa0was actually a Canadian group that sequenced the SARS genome back in 2003, and that group and many others are using what we learned from that case to actually tackle the coronavirus that we have today.Â\\xa0  Canada is a world-leader when it comes to health-related genomics research.  The number one priority is clearly the care and protection of patients and the safety of our frontline health personnelâ\\x80\\x94obviouslyÂ\\xa0we need to make sure we are making a lot of investments in protective equipment, safety protocols, treatment processes and so on. That is obviously the number one area of focus.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 After that Iâ\\x80\\x99d say that reallyÂ\\xa0the big need right nowâ\\x80\\x94when it comes to the research sideâ\\x80\\x94is to develop rapid testing and point-of-care testing so that we can actually go to the bedside of quarantined patients and get test results very quickly.Â\\xa0That will really allow us to help both identify sick patients but also track the disease progression.Â\\xa0  The big need right nowâ\\x80\\x94when it comes to the research sideâ\\x80\\x94is to develop rapid testing and point-of-care testing so that we can actually go to the bedside of quarantined patients and get test results very quickly.  So rapid diagnostics is a major area of focus. Of course, after that we shift to treatments and therapeuticsâ\\x80\\x94and here we are talking about both vaccines and drugsâ\\x80\\x94and those are probably a little more long-term in terms of their impact, but it is important that we get that work started now. And there are potentially areas where we can hopefully find some shortcuts to speed those up.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 Content continues below â\\x86\\x93 What we are seeing now is probably an appropriate response, which is that we are actually finding a lot of different approaches across the country and around the world, and what we really need is actually a lot of different people trying a lot of different things in order to identify what works.Â\\xa0Leadership is clearly important, and I give full marks to the federal government and the provincial governments for being open and communicative about their intentions and by taking bold action.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 And so leadership matters, but at the same time I would say community-driven responses led by researchers who are open with their results, sharing their data and information, and working collaboratively across borders is really going to be the key to helping us find the quickest way to solve this crisis.Â\\xa0 I have to say I am impressed with what Iâ\\x80\\x99ve seen so far in terms of community response, and I think that certainly the private sector is looking for ways to get involved.Â\\xa0On the research side of things,Â\\xa0we know of a number of collaborations involving both academic and government scientists, as well as companies who are going to be essential in terms of the production of any drug or vaccine that comes along. Those kinds of collaborations are going to be absolutely essentialâ\\x80\\x94but of course this isnâ\\x80\\x99t simply a medical crisis. The medical crisis, in a sense, is blooming into other areas. There is the actual coronavirus itselfâ\\x80\\x94that we need to figure out solutions forâ\\x80\\x94but there will be enormous psychosocial impacts, for instance, and so we need to be thinking of mental health issues, and that is going to involve a different set of healthcare providers and community supports.Â\\xa0We know there is already a lot of economic disruption, so it really is a multifaceted challenge that is going to require everybody to be thinking of how they can contribute to the impact, beyond simply looking at the impact of the virus itself.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 Genomics really is a field of study that looks at how all the molecular systems work together inside living things. That starts with the genome, which is the DNA inside an organism, but it goes beyond that into how the DNA translates into all the other molecular systems inside of living things.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 Chinese scientists were able to sequence the Covid-19 genome in just ten days.Â\\xa0When we sequenced the SARS genome, it took us several weeks.Â\\xa0Within ten days we actually had the blueprint of DNA that the coronavirus has, and that helps us in a number of ways. First, it allows us to take a few guesses as to how the virus actually works and point a way towards understanding transmission, which helps us come up with strategies for containment. Secondly, having the viral genome gives us a target to look for when we are looking at diagnostics. It opens the doors to a variety of methods to improve diagnostics and to do so in a way that is potentially very quick.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 Chinese scientists were able to sequence the Covid-19 genome in just ten days.Â\\xa0When we sequenced the SARS genome, it took us several weeks.  The third thing is, of course, it provides a number of potential targets for vaccine development and possible drug development. At a very basic level, even just having the coronavirus genome opens up lots of opportunities, and then we layer on top of that the very clever people working on a number of thingsâ\\x80\\x94for instance how theÂ\\xa0coronavirus genome interacts with patient genomes and other systems in order to understand why it is that some patients get very, very, very sick and others do not. Those are very important questions and solving those kinds of questions may very well open the door for possible lines of attack in terms of therapy.Â\\xa0 The federal government,Â\\xa0right out of the gate,Â\\xa0was very quickÂ\\xa0in trying toÂ\\xa0respond on a research level to the challenges being created by the coronavirus.Â\\xa0Early on [Genome Canada] got involved in a coordinated effort with a variety of other federal organizations including theÂ\\xa0CIHR,Â\\xa0NSERC, theÂ\\xa0Social Sciences and Humanities CouncilÂ\\xa0as well as theÂ\\xa0IDRC, in a coordinated effort to fund the first round of projects that would try to mount a rapid response to the Covid-19 pandemic. A variety of really fascinating projects came out of that.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 The one Iâ\\x80\\x99ll focus on is a project weâ\\x80\\x99re funding at theÂ\\xa0University of CalgaryÂ\\xa0led byÂ\\xa0Dr.Â\\xa0Dylan Pillai, which is really focused on developing rapid diagnostics. AndÂ\\xa0his team is looking to build a portable diagnostic tool that could be handheldâ\\x80\\x94and actually brought to the bedside of quarantined patientsâ\\x80\\x94and can be used globally.Â\\xa0It is a really innovative approach to developing those tests and we are quite hopeful that that work will yield positive results, as well as the other couple of dozen projects that got seeded across the country.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 It is about where we can contribute most meaningfully. We know that in Canada we have unique challengesâ\\x80\\x94that are posed by our geography, for instanceâ\\x80\\x94there may be other unique challenges posed by populations unique to Canadaâ\\x80\\x94and so we need to be solving and addressing some of those unique challenges while at the same time contributing to global efforts.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 One of the things about these pandemics, of course, is that as the virus spreads it changes and it mutates, and it takes on potentially differentÂ\\xa0behaviors. We need to make sure that we are contributing globally to data and information sets, so that we can look at not simply what is happening in a single hospital or a single province, but really globally how our experience is comparing to the experience of the United States, Italy, and South Korea.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 We need to make sure that we are contributing globally to data and information sets, so that we can look at not simply what is happening in a single hospital or a single province. The scientists are better coordinated than a lot of the institutions. We work certainly hard to connect with our international partners, and I have been in touch with my colleagues in other countries. But it is the scientists who are actually on the ground doing the workâ\\x80\\x94they knowÂ\\xa0who they need to speak to, who the expert is that can help them at a given time and who needs to know the results of the experiment they are running. ScienceÂ\\xa0really is a community-led activity, and the community is really committed here.Â\\xa0AndÂ\\xa0soÂ\\xa0our job, as funding institutions and so on, is to many ways put wind in their sails. There is a double-sided approach here. On the one hand, we want to demonstrate leadership by helping provide coordination, but at the same time we want to be sure we are providing the scientists the tools they need to address the problem amongst themselves.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 We are mounting a very impressive response globally to this crisis, but the reason we can do that is we have been funding scientists for decades.Â\\xa0  Within that there is a little bit of a lessonâ\\x80\\x94I think it is important for us as a take-home lesson hereâ\\x80\\x94is thatÂ\\xa0we are mounting a very impressive response globally to this crisis, but the reason we can do that is we have been funding scientists for decades.Â\\xa0Virologists are working away, and training students, and pushing the envelope in terms of technologies and understandingâ\\x80\\x94and when the crisis hits, they are ready to respond. There is both the rapid response element to this that is absolutely essentialâ\\x80\\x94but there is also a background level of activity, that we need to make sure that we have, that is healthy and strong so that when crises do come up we actually have a community of scientists or other types of researchers ready to respond and to jump into action.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 Nobody has the definite answer as to when we will find some type of cure or treatment.Â\\xa0First what we are going to see, and I am very confident about this, are real increases in our ability to do effective and rapid testing.Â\\xa0And that is essential, we really do need quicker testing and so that we can really do widespread testing to a get a better sense of what we are dealing with.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 After that, we will hopefully see significant improvements just in medical treatment of those who are infected by the coronavirus so that we can help reduce mortalityâ\\x80\\x94and I think we are going to see that.Â\\xa0When it comes to actual vaccine or cure development, these things take timeâ\\x80\\x94we hear numbers of 18 months to two years. Having said that, there are some innovative approaches that may well short-circuit that a little bit andÂ\\xa0may get something a little quicker.Â\\xa0There are a number of people looking at repurposing existing drugsâ\\x80\\x94other antivirals, for example. Those testsâ\\x80\\x94we do not know for sureâ\\x80\\x94but it may well be there is some impact from existing treatments that could actually also help provide a shortcut to some kind of treatment.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 Again,Â\\xa0this is about having that diverse community approach. You have the researchers who are going to say, ok, I am aiming at the 18-month vaccine and I am going to make sure every day I get us closer to that. And then you have other researchers that say ok, good, if you have that on lockdown, I will take more of a risky approach and try to screen existing drugs, for instance. And then you have others who say ok, if you are all doing that, I am going to look at how we might actually target the human targets to see if we can somehow block the virus. There are a lot of different approaches being taken and our hope and our expectation is that there will be a variety of successes that will help get us closer to actually managing this effectively.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 Yes, this will certainly happen again. We are creatures of biology, and it is importantâ\\x80\\x94for all of our progressâ\\x80\\x94we remain at the whims of biological process.Â\\xa0There have always been human pandemics and there will likely always be human pandemics. Having said that, we are much better positioned today to deal with this outbreak than we were to deal with the SARS outbreak.Â\\xa0And we were better positioned to deal with the SARS outbreak than we were to deal with the Spanish flu, and so on and so forth. And so, every time we learn a little more, we get a littleÂ\\xa0betterâ\\x80\\x94but the fact is that humans are biological creatures and as such we are prone to the afflictions that have plagued us for centuries.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 The areas where I am more comfortable are around the research and application of the research result.Â\\xa0The lessons here are that we have a strong, committed, talented community that are ready to respond.Â\\xa0Thatâ\\x80\\x99s phenomenal. I give full marks to the federal and provincial government for acting very quickly in terms of making new funds available and being very open to ideas from the community about how to move forward.Â\\xa0Thatâ\\x80\\x99s all really great.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 Going forward, I think there is a riskâ\\x80\\x94there have been challenges, with regards to sustained funding for what is considered basic or fundamental research, which is basic and fundamental until a crisis like this hitsâ\\x80\\x94and suddenly, you are the virologist looking at mechanisms for viral transmission and the science does not seem so arcane anymore. Suddenly, it seems very germane.Â\\xa0We need to recognize the value of making good, long-term, sustained investments and thatÂ\\xa0theyÂ\\xa0serve society.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 The second thing Iâ\\x80\\x99ll say is that we are living in a world of data, and the healthcare system is not unique in its challenges of managing large quantities of data and moving that data around efficiently and effectively, but also with appropriate controls. Going forward, it will be really important for us to think about how hospitals and research institutions are able to collect data from patients, on viral strains, and then make that data available across provincial and national borders so that we can work collectively together. That is a policy challenge that is well understood and recognized, but it is one that is not as simple to solve as we might hope.Â\\xa0 The silver lining is a reminder of just how strongÂ\\xa0we are inÂ\\xa0research. ThatÂ\\xa0Canada can beâ\\x80\\x94it isâ\\x80\\x94amongÂ\\xa0the leaders globally,Â\\xa0and it is playing an important role in addressing these challenges.  It is hard to look for the silver lining given the challenges we are facing, butÂ\\xa0I am inspired by the commitment I am seeing among Canadians and people internationally who are coming together to work collectively to try to minimize the impact of the pandemic.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0I am thinking about everyone from organizations deciding to self-isolate and work from home, individuals making sure that they are not going to be congregating or giving up trips and activities that they may have well been looking forward to for months or years.Â\\xa0 On top of that, the commitment of workers who do go in every day and continue to work in our nursing rooms, our hospitals and our fast food places.Â\\xa0That, to me, brings home the value of community and the commitment that we share in that regard. That is a big silver lining.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 More directly, in terms of my area,Â\\xa0the silver lining is a reminder of just how strongÂ\\xa0we are inÂ\\xa0research. ThatÂ\\xa0Canada can beâ\\x80\\x94it isâ\\x80\\x94amongÂ\\xa0the leaders globally,Â\\xa0and it is playing an important role in addressing these challenges.Â\\xa0The last several years have been sometimes challenging for scienceâ\\x80\\x94there is a lot of fake news and misinformation on the web, like anti-vaccination, for example. There have been a lot of challenges in regard to the role science plays in peoplesâ\\x80\\x99 everyday livesâ\\x80\\x94but whatÂ\\xa0we are seeing today, isÂ\\xa0thatÂ\\xa0when it comes to a real global crisis like this, science canÂ\\xa0lead, and science does lead. It will provide the tools that we can use to try to get out of this difficult time.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been working from home, obviously, but using this time to get caught up on some reading. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been actually hanging out with my teenage kids, which is great, and introducing them to a lot of kungÂ\\xa0fuÂ\\xa0movies from the 70s and 80sâ\\x80\\x94which has been great. And then Genome Canada has been building a playlist of shut-in music, so that has been providing the soundtrack for a lot of the work we are doing here at our house.Â\\xa0 Dr. Rob AnnanÂ\\xa0is President and CEO of Genome Canada. He drives an overarching strategy that promotes the value and potential of genomics in Canada. A Fellow of the Public Policy Forum, he has led projects and convened discussions around research and innovation strategy. His prior experience includes seven years at Mitacs, including as Chief Research Officer and interim CEO, where he drove the development and delivery of policy-driven innovation programs. Dr. Annan volunteers on the Board of Letâ\\x80\\x99s Talk Science, a national charity dedicated to increasing STEM literacy among K-12 students. He has a Ph.D. in Biochemistry from McGill University and undergraduate degrees in English from Queenâ\\x80\\x99s University and in Biology from the University of Victoria. Genome Canada is a not-for-profit organization, funded by the Government of Canada that acts as a catalyst for developing and applying genomics and genomic-based technologies to create economic and social benefits for Canadians. It connect ideas and people across public and private sectors to find new uses for genomics; invests in large-scale science and technology to fuel innovation; and, translates discoveries into solutions across key sectors of national importance, including health, agriculture and agri-food, forestry, fisheries and aquaculture, the environment, energy and mining.

HealthCOVID-19CoronavirusBy AFP Saturday 14 March 2020, 11:30AM The true danger of coronavirus is unlikely to be the death toll, as experts say health systems could easily become overwhelmed by the number of cases requiring hospitalisation. Photo: AFP Mortality COVID-19, the illness caused by coronavirus, proves deadly in around 3.5% of confirmed cases. While this is not the same as its mortality rate, given many people may be infected but not realise it, it is significantly higher than seasonal flu, which typically kills 0.1% of patients. â\\x80\\x9cThere is still considerable uncertainty around the fatality rates of COVID-19 and it likely varies depending on the quality of local healthcare,â\\x80\\x9d said Francois Balloux, Professor of Computational Systems Biology at University College London. â\\x80\\x9cThat said, it is around 2% on average, which is about 20 times higher than for the seasonal flu lineages currently in circulation.â\\x80\\x9d Serious cases But the true danger of coronavirus is unlikely to be the death toll. Experts say health systems could easily become overwhelmed by the number of cases requiring hospitalisation â\\x80\\x93 and, often ventilation to support breathing. An analysis of 45,000 confirmed cases in China, where the epidemic originated, show that the vast majority of deaths were among the elderly (14.8% mortality among over 80s). But another Chinese study showed that 41% of serious cases occurred among under 50s, compared with 27% among over 65s. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s true that if youâ\\x80\\x99re older youâ\\x80\\x99re at greater risk, but serious cases can also happen in relatively young people with no prior conditions,â\\x80\\x9d said French deputy health minister Jerome Salomon. Â\\xa0 Contagiousness Disease experts estimate that each COVID-19 sufferer infects between two to three others. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s a reproduction rate up to twice as high as seasonal flu, which typically infects 1.3 new people for each patient. Vaccine / treatment Salomon said that humans have lived with influenza for more than 100 years. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ve studied it closely,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThis new virus resembles the flu in terms of physical symptoms but there are huge differences.â\\x80\\x9d Number one is the lack of a vaccine against COVID-19, or even any treatment shown to be consistently effective. While some trials have shown promise delivering anti-retroviral drugs to serious cases, as well as some experimental therapies, their sample sizes are too small to roll out to the general population. Hundreds of researchers around the world are working frantically to find a COVID-19 vaccine, but the development process takes months and is likely too late for the current outbreak. Even if a vaccine magically appeared, getting everyone access it to it is no small order. Health authorities regularly complain that not enough people receive the flu vaccine to guarantee â\\x80\\x9cherd immunityâ\\x80\\x9d. Similarities But the new virus does share some characteristics with flu, notably the measures each one of us can personally take to slow the infection rate: Avoid shaking hands, frequently wash your hands with soap and water, avoid touching your face and wear a mask if you are sick. Such actions can limit new infections just as they can with the flu, gastro illnesses and other infectious diseases. Franceâ\\x80\\x99s health ministry says that only two in 10 people regularly wash their hands after using the bathroom. â\\x80\\x9cAnd only 42% of people cover their mouth with an elbow or tissue when they cough or sneeze,â\\x80\\x9d it added, not encouragingly. \\n * Please login to comment.

       " '\\nA novel respiratory virus that originated in Wuhan, China, last December has spread to six continents. Hundreds of thousands have been infected, at least 20,000 people have died and the spread of the coronavirus was called a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March.\\nMuch remains unknown about the virus, including how many people may have very mild or asymptomatic infections, and whether they can transmit the virus. The precise dimensions of the outbreak are hard to know.\\nHere’s what scientists have learned so far about the virus and the outbreak.What is a coronavirus?\\nCoronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their surfaces, resembling a crown or the sun’s corona. They can infect both animals and people, and can cause illnesses of the respiratory tract.\\nAt least four types of coronaviruses cause very mild infections every year, like the common cold. Most people get infected with one or more of these viruses at some point in their lives.\\nAnother coronavirus that circulated in China in 2003 caused a more dangerous condition known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. The virus was contained after it had sickened 8,098 people and killed 774.\\nMiddle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, is also caused by a coronavirus.\\nThe new virus has been named SARS-CoV-2. The disease it causes is called Covid-19. How dangerous is it?It is hard to accurately assess the lethality of a new virus. It appears to be less often fatal than the coronaviruses that caused SARS or MERS, but significantly more so than the seasonal flu. The fatality rate was over 2 percent, in one study. But government scientists have estimated that the real figure could be below 1 percent, roughly the rate occurring in a severe flu season.\\nAbout 5 percent of the patients who were hospitalized in China had critical illnesses. Children seem less likely to be infected with the new coronavirus, while middle-aged and older adults are disproportionately infected.\\nMen are more likely to die from an infection compared to women, possibly because they produce weaker immune responses and have higher rates of tobacco consumption, Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure than women, which may increase the risk of complications following an infection.\\n“This is a pattern we’ve seen with many viral infections of the respiratory tract — men can have worse outcomes,” said Sabra Klein, a scientist who studies sex differences in viral infections and vaccination responses at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\\nHow is the new coronavirus transmitted?Experts believe that an infected animal may have first transmitted the virus to humans at a market that sold live fish, animals and birds in Wuhan. The market was later shut down and disinfected, making it nearly impossible to investigate which animal may have been the exact origin.\\nBats are considered a possible source, because they have evolved to coexist with many viruses, and they were found to be the starting point for SARS. It is also possible that bats transmitted the virus to an intermediate animal, such as pangolins, which are consumed as a delicacy in parts of China, and may have then passed on the virus to humans.\\nThe outbreak grew because of human-to-human transmission.\\nPeople infected with the virus produce tiny respiratory droplets when they breathe, talk, cough or sneeze, allowing the virus to travel through the air.\\nMost respiratory droplets fall to the ground within a few feet. People who are in close contact with those infected, particularly family members and health care workers, may catch the virus this way.\\nScientists don’t know how long the new coronavirus can live on surfaces, and preliminary research suggests that hot and humid environments may not slow down the pathogen’s spread. Warm weather does tend to inhibit influenza and milder coronaviruses.\\nInfected people may be able to pass on the new coronavirus even if they have few obvious symptoms, a study in Germany has found. That’s “bad news,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an expert in infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.\\nWhen people don’t know they are infected, “they’re up and about, going to work or the gym or to religious services, and breathing on or near other people,” he said. Still, a report by the World Health Organization suggests that asymptomatic cases are rare.\\n\\nWhat symptoms should I look out for?Symptoms of this infection include fever, cough and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. The illness causes lung lesions and pneumonia. But milder cases may resemble the flu or a bad cold, making detection difficult.\\nPatients may exhibit other symptoms, too, such as gastrointestinal problems or diarrhea. Current estimates suggest that symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after being exposed to the virus.\\nIf you have a fever or a cough and recently visited China, South Korea, Italy or another place with a known coronavirus outbreak, or spent time with someone who did, see your health care provider. Call first, so the office can prepare for your visit and take steps to protect other patients and staff from potential exposure.\\nIs there a test for the virus? What is the treatment? There is a diagnostic test that can determine if you are infected. It was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based on genetic information about the virus provided by the Chinese authorities.\\nIn early February, the C.D.C. sent diagnostic test kits to 200 state laboratories, but some of the kits were flawed and recalled. Now other laboratories are making their own tests. Other countries are using test kits manufactured locally or sent out by the W.H.O.\\nThe C.D.C. announced that anyone who wanted to be tested could, if a doctor approves the request. Private companies, such as LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics, are also rushing to provide tests at various labs across the country, but the supply has yet to meet public demand. Many patients complain that they still cannot get tested.\\n\\nOnce a coronavirus infection is confirmed, the treatment is mainly supportive,  making sure the patient is getting enough oxygen, managing his or her fever and using a ventilator to push air into the lungs if necessary, said Dr. Julie Vaishampayan, chairwoman of the public health committee at the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\\nPatients with mild cases are told to rest and drink plenty of fluids “while the immune system does its job and heals itself,” she said. Most people with mild infections recover in about two weeks. More than half of those who have been infected globally have already  recovered.\\nA number of drugs are currently being tested as potential treatments, including  an antiviral medication called remdesivir, which appears to be effective in animals and was used to treat the first American patient in Washington State. The National Institutes of Health is testing the drug on infected patient in a clinical trial in Nebraska. The drug’s maker, Gilead, has also begun trials at various sites in Asia.\\nHow long will it take to develop a vaccine?A coronavirus vaccine is still months away — and perhaps years. While new technology, advancements in genomics and improved global coordination have allowed researchers to act quickly, vaccine development remains an expensive and risky process.\\nAfter the SARS outbreak in 2003, it took researchers about 20 months to get a vaccine ready for human trials. (The vaccine was never needed, because the disease was eventually contained.)\\nBy the time of the Zika outbreak in 2015, researchers had brought the vaccine development timeline down to six months.\\nNow, they hope that work from past outbreaks will help cut the timeline further. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health and several companies are working on vaccine candidates.\\nDr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said a preliminary clinical trial might get off the ground in as little as three months. But researchers would still need to conduct extensive testing to prove a vaccine was safe and effective.\\nHow can I protect myself?The best thing you can do to avoid getting infected is to follow the same general guidelines that experts recommend during flu season, because the coronavirus spreads in much the same way. Wash your hands frequently throughout the day. Avoid touching your face, and maintain a distance — at least six feet — from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.\\nThe risk of infection with the new coronavirus in the United States “is way too low for the general public to start wearing a face mask,” said Dr. Peter Rabinowitz, co-director of the University of Washington MetaCenter for Pandemic Preparedness and Global Health Security.\\nBut, he added, “if you have symptoms of a respiratory illness, wearing a mask reduces the risk of infecting others.”\\nShould I cancel my international travel plans?Many countries have also enacted travel restrictions and bans, closing their doors to people from countries with sustained transmission of the virus. Governments around the world have been screening incoming passengers for signs of illness.\\nIs it too late to contain the virus? W.H.O. officials have credited lockdown measures China imposed in late January for averting the spread of more cases from Wuhan. China sealed off cities, shut down businesses and schools, and ordered residents to remain in their homes. Officials use cellphone data to track and intercept those who have been to Hubei Province.\\nIn recent weeks, government workers have gone door-to-door to round up people who are infected, placing them in stadiums and other buildings that have been converted to makeshift hospitals. Now, official reports suggest that new cases in China are waning.\\nBut there is growing fear that containment may no longer be possible. Clarence Tam, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at the School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore, said the surge of cases in multiple countries was “concerning because we know the transmissions are spreading at a fast rate.”\\n“We’ve learned some things of this new virus for the past couple of weeks that make it seem unlikely that containment will be a strategy that will completely stop this virus,” he added.\\nThere is benefit to delaying its spread as long as possible. Containing the virus may buy health officials more time to stock hospitals with test kits and respirators, and for local governments, companies and schools to enact strategies — telecommuting and online classes, for instance — that may reduce the spread.\\nBut the ability of nations to prepare for the arrival of coronavirus cases will depend largely on the strength of their health systems, capacity to conduct tests and effectiveness in communicating updates to the public.\\n“We have been dealing with flu for decades, and even now it seems some countries don’t even have a policy for influenza preparedness,” said Leo Poon, head of the University of Hong Kong’s public health laboratory sciences division. “Not to mention something which is new to them. That’s a problem.”\\n',\n",
