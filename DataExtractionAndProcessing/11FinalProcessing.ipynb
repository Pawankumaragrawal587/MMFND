HealthCOVID-19CoronavirusBy AFP Saturday 14 March 2020, 11:30AM The true danger of coronavirus is unlikely to be the death toll, as experts say health systems could easily become overwhelmed by the number of cases requiring hospitalisation. Photo: AFP Mortality COVID-19, the illness caused by coronavirus, proves deadly in around 3.5% of confirmed cases. While this is not the same as its mortality rate, given many people may be infected but not realise it, it is significantly higher than seasonal flu, which typically kills 0.1% of patients. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThere is still considerable uncertainty around the fatality rates of COVID-19 and it likely varies depending on the quality of local healthcare,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Francois Balloux, Professor of Computational Systems Biology at University College London. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThat said, it is around 2% on average, which is about 20 times higher than for the seasonal flu lineages currently in circulation.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Serious cases But the true danger of coronavirus is unlikely to be the death toll. Experts say health systems could easily become overwhelmed by the number of cases requiring hospitalisation Ã¢\\x80\\x93 and, often ventilation to support breathing. An analysis of 45,000 confirmed cases in China, where the epidemic originated, show that the vast majority of deaths were among the elderly (14.8% mortality among over 80s). But another Chinese study showed that 41% of serious cases occurred among under 50s, compared with 27% among over 65s. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s true that if youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re older youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re at greater risk, but serious cases can also happen in relatively young people with no prior conditions,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said French deputy health minister Jerome Salomon. Ã‚\\xa0 Contagiousness Disease experts estimate that each COVID-19 sufferer infects between two to three others. ThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a reproduction rate up to twice as high as seasonal flu, which typically infects 1.3 new people for each patient. Vaccine / treatment Salomon said that humans have lived with influenza for more than 100 years. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWeÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve studied it closely,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThis new virus resembles the flu in terms of physical symptoms but there are huge differences.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Number one is the lack of a vaccine against COVID-19, or even any treatment shown to be consistently effective. While some trials have shown promise delivering anti-retroviral drugs to serious cases, as well as some experimental therapies, their sample sizes are too small to roll out to the general population. Hundreds of researchers around the world are working frantically to find a COVID-19 vaccine, but the development process takes months and is likely too late for the current outbreak. Even if a vaccine magically appeared, getting everyone access it to it is no small order. Health authorities regularly complain that not enough people receive the flu vaccine to guarantee Ã¢\\x80\\x9cherd immunityÃ¢\\x80\\x9d. Similarities But the new virus does share some characteristics with flu, notably the measures each one of us can personally take to slow the infection rate: Avoid shaking hands, frequently wash your hands with soap and water, avoid touching your face and wear a mask if you are sick. Such actions can limit new infections just as they can with the flu, gastro illnesses and other infectious diseases. FranceÃ¢\\x80\\x99s health ministry says that only two in 10 people regularly wash their hands after using the bathroom. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd only 42% of people cover their mouth with an elbow or tissue when they cough or sneeze,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d it added, not encouragingly. \\n * Please login to comment.

       "        \"Filed under: Stay alert, and be prepared Public health experts around the globe are scrambling to understand, track, and contain a virus that appeared in Wuhan, China, at the beginning of December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease caused by the virus COVID-19, which references the type of virus and the year it emerged. The WHO declared that the virus is a pandemic.  The Verge will update this page as new information emerges. You can also find our breakdown of what research shows about how to live in a pandemic world here.  A newsletter highlighting the COVID-19 research, developments, and stories that matter. Subscribe here! You can see where and how many cases of the illness have been reported on this map. As this important story continues to unfold, our hope is to keep you up to date as people work to understand this virus and contain its spread. Table of contents Where did the virus come from?  At the end of December, public health officials from China informed the World Health Organization that they had a problem: an unknown, new virus was causing pneumonia-like illness in the city of Wuhan. They quickly determined that it was a coronavirus and that it was rapidly spreading through and outside of Wuhan.  Coronaviruses are common in animals of all kinds, and they sometimes can evolve into forms that can infect humans. Since the start of the century, two other coronaviruses have jumped to humans, causing the SARS outbreak in 2002 and the MERS outbreak in 2012. Scientists think this new virus first became capable of jumping to humans at the beginning of December. It originally seemed like the virus first infected people at a seafood market in Wuhan and spread from there. But one analysis of early cases of the illness, published on January 24th, found that the first patient to get sick did not have any contact with the market. Experts are still trying to trace the outbreak back to its source.  The type of animal the virus originated from is not clear, although one analysis found that the genetic sequence of the new virus is 96 percent identical to one coronavirus found in bats. Both SARS and MERS originated in bats.  Where is it spreading? The virus is now spreading all over the world.  Although it originated in China, the country took aggressive action at the start of the outbreak, shutting down transportation in some cities and suspending public gatherings. Officials isolated sick people and aggressively tracked their contacts, and had a dedicated network of hospitals to test for the virus.  Countries like New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea have successfully slowed the pandemic. The US has not, and it is an epicenter of the crisis.  How dangerous is this new virus? It takes information about both how severe an illness is and how easily it can spread to determine how Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbadÃ¢\\x80\\x9d it can be. Epidemiologists often use this tool to assess new strains of the flu, for example: If an illness isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t very severe (and kills only a small percentage of people), but itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s highly transmissible, it can still be devastating. An easily transmitted illness that kills a small percentage of the people it infects can still cause a lot of deaths, precisely because so many people get sick.  The WHO named the illness caused by the coronavirus COVID-19 Ã¢\\x80\\x94 Ã¢\\x80\\x9ccoÃ¢\\x80\\x9d and Ã¢\\x80\\x9cviÃ¢\\x80\\x9d for coronavirus, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cdÃ¢\\x80\\x9d for disease, and Ã¢\\x80\\x9c19Ã¢\\x80\\x9d for the year when the disease emerged.  COVID-19 is a serious illness, and itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s much more dangerous than the flu. One Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) projection suggests that between 160 to 214 million people will eventually be infected in the US and that between 200,000 and 1.7 million could die.  The symptoms of COVID-19 have ranged from mild, like those in a cold, to severe. Around 80 percent of confirmed cases are mild and donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t require hospitalization Ã¢\\x80\\x94 at least, 80 percent of the cases that we know about. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s still possible that there are more mild cases of the illness that havenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t been flagged, which would shrink the percentage of cases that are severe. In about 15 percent of people, the illness is severe enough that they need to be hospitalized, and about 5 percent of cases are critical. It appears around half of the people with critical cases of the illness die from it.  Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMildÃ¢\\x80\\x9d cases, though, can still be debilitating. Some people with the disease say they couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t get out of bed for weeks. For many people, the effects of the illness linger: some people report running fevers for months or experiencing waves of fatigue that make it hard to run errands or walk up the stairs. Researchers donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know why symptoms last so long, even after people no longer test positive for the virus. So far, experts say that around 1 percent of people who get sick with COVID-19 will die, though itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s still too early to say for sure how often it is fatal. In the US, around 5 percent of people with confirmed cases of the virus have died from it, but that doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t account for the people who didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know they were infected or who weren't able to get tested.  Different groups of people are more at risk of having a severe case of the illness or of dying from it. Most deaths in this outbreak have been in older people and those who have underlying health issues, like heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes. In that group, people are more at risk of dying. Around 14 percent of people over the age of 80 who get sick will die, for example.  How easily can the virus spread? The virus moves rapidly. The new coronavirus spreads quickly in contained environments, like on the Diamond Princess cruise ship.  Early evidence suggested that, like other coronaviruses, the virus jumps between people who are in very close contact with each other. It also probably spreads when an infected person sneezes or coughs. Coughs and sneezes produce little droplets of mucus and saliva. If these droplets make it into another personÃ¢\\x80\\x99s eyes, mouth, or nose, they can get sick. The viruses in those little droplets can also fall onto surfaces, like tables or doorknobs Ã¢\\x80\\x94 if someone touches that surface and touches their eyes, mouth, or nose, they can also get sick.  The smallest of those droplets can also linger in the air after a sick person coughs or sneezes or when they breathe and talk. People can probably get infected by those clouds of lingering droplets, even though scientists still donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know how often that actually happens. ThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s why being inside, particularly in poorly ventilated rooms, is dangerous: tiny virus-carrying droplets wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t circulate out in the same way they would outdoors.  We also donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know when people with COVID-19 become contagious or how long being contagious lasts. One study of nine people in Germany with mild cases of the illness found that they had high levels of the virus in their throats early on in the course of the disease before they felt very sick. Research out of China showed that people without symptoms still have high levels of the virus in their throats and noses. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s probably possible for people to spread the virus to others before they feel sick. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s also possible that people who never feel sick and are truly asymptomatic can infect other people. Researchers still donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know how often those people actually end up spreading the disease. Some studies suggest that people who do have symptoms are much more likely to spread the virus to others.  Each sick person will go on to infect, on average, between 1.4 and 2.5 additional people, the WHO says, though thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s an early estimate. Other teams of researchers have published their own estimates, with most saying a sick person will infect an average of around two or three people.  Those numbers are called the virusÃ¢\\x80\\x99s R0 (pronounced Ã¢\\x80\\x9cR-naughtÃ¢\\x80\\x9d). The R0 is the mathematical representation of how well an infection might be able to spread. The higher the number, the easier the disease is to spread. For comparison, the R0 for SARS was between two and five. But that doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t mean each sick person will actually infect that many people; quarantines and other actions taken to control outbreaks of a virus can bring down the number of people a sick person infects. The R0 is also just an average. Researchers think this particular illness happens in clusters and tends to cause Ã¢\\x80\\x9csuperspreadingÃ¢\\x80\\x9d events. Some estimate that as few as 10 percent of COVID-19 cases are responsible for 80 percent of the diseaseÃ¢\\x80\\x99s spread Ã¢\\x80\\x94 that is, most people donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t infect anyone else, and a few people set off chain reactions that infect dozens.  Can we treat this virus?  Since the start of the pandemic, doctors have gotten better at treating patients with COVID-19 in the hospital. There still isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t much doctors can do for people with mild cases of the illness who arenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t sick enough to be hospitalized. But trials of synthetic antibodies are underway, and they might be able to help prevent people who catch the virus from becoming seriously ill.  In October, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved remdesivir, an antiviral medication originally developed for Ebola, to treat the disease Ã¢\\x80\\x94 even though clinical trials found that it only has a limited benefit.  There was a lot of early hype around the anti-malaria medication chloroquine, but clinical trials showed that it doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t actually help COVID-19 patients. Clinical trials did show, though, that a cheap steroid called dexamethasone could help people who are hospitalized with very severe cases of the disease.  Research teams and pharmaceutical companies are also working to develop a vaccine that can protect people from infection. However, vaccine development takes a long time. Even if everything goes smoothly, it will be around a year to 18 months from the start of the development process before one is available, said Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. What can I do to protect myself and others? Stay home if youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re feeling sick, even if youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re just a little bit under the weather. Stay home as much as possible even if youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re not feeling sick. If you do go out, wear a cloth mask or face covering when youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re out in public, especially in places where itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s hard to stay far away from others. While theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re not perfect, a cloth face covering could help stop you from spreading virus-laden particles to other people, even if you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re sick. They could also partially block the virus from reaching your nose or mouth. If everyone wears them, some studies show they could help slow the spread of the virus.  Many states are slowly starting to let restaurants, barbershops, and retail stores open, even though the disease is still spreading rapidly in some places. The CDC released guidelines on June 12th, outlining the relative risk of everyday activities and the ways people should protect themselves when they venture out to the bank or the gym.  Spending time with a few people is less risky than hanging out with a large group, and everyone should wear masks and keep at a distance, the CDC says. The risk of contracting COVID-19 (or spreading it) goes up if you spend time with other people indoors rather than outside.  Before deciding if you should do a particular activity, the agency recommends thinking about how many new cases are being reported each day in your area. If the case numbers are low, the risk is lower than if hundreds of new people are being diagnosed with COVID-19 each day. You should also think about how closely youÃ¢\\x80\\x99d be interacting with other people (and if theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99d be wearing a mask). If youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re a young, healthy person, you might not feel very sick if you catch COVID-19. But you could pass it on to someone older or with a chronic health condition who is more likely to have a severe case of the disease.  If I already had COVID-19, am I immune? Many researchers think that after someone is infected with the coronavirus, thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a good chance that person wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t get sick from the virus again for some still-undetermined amount of time. ThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s based on what scientists know about how most viruses work. Usually, when youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re sick from a viral infection, your body develops antibodies against that virus. The next time youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re exposed to the virus, those antibodies could stop it from turning into a raging illness Ã¢\\x80\\x94 though that isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t always the case.  There isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t concrete evidence that people who got sick once with COVID-19 canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t get sick again because no studies have specifically tested that idea. But virologists donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think that this virus behaves differently than most other viruses Ã¢\\x80\\x94 so people who did get sick are probably protected. The question, though, is for how long: for some viruses, the protection fades after a year or a few years. There arenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t answers to that question yet.  WhatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s happening in the US? US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar declared a public health emergency in response to the coronavirus at the end of January, and President Trump declared a federal emergency in March.  As the overall case counts rose through March and April, governors and local officials closed nonessential businesses and told people to work from home and stay away from others. The interventions are helped to slow the spread of the disease in some areas, but many states Ã¢\\x80\\x94 including Texas, Arizona, and Florida Ã¢\\x80\\x94 lifted restrictions before public health experts thought it was safe.  Through the summer of 2020, cases in those places rapidly increased. After a long plateau, spikes in some Southern and Western US states pushed up new daily case numbers in the US. A fall surge hit the whole country, sending case numbers above the summer highs. The Midwest has the highest burden of disease, but hospitalizations are climbing all over the country.  Early in 2020, the virus spread undetected for weeks in the US. Initially, CDC guidelines did not allow testing unless a sick person had been in a country with an ongoing spread of the virus or who had been in contact with someone with a confirmed case of the disease could be tested. That delayed the diagnosis of patients who did not have those risk factors.  The US is doing around one million COVID-19 tests per day, according to data collected by volunteers at the COVID Tracking Project. Testing was slow to get off the ground in the US. It took too long for the FDA and the CDC to develop and distribute a functioning test and longer still for testing capacity to increase.  Many public health agencies across the country also still arenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t getting in touch with everyone who tests positive for the virus to find the people they may have exposed Ã¢\\x80\\x94 a critical public health tool called contact tracing. The US needs to scale up its contact tracing workforce in order to control the outbreak. The US currently has the worst outbreak of any country in the world.    \",\n",

Air traffic data via FlightRadar24   The aviation industryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s unprecedented free fall from the coronavirus pandemic already has forced some airlines into bankruptcy, and others are on the brink.   Business and leisure travel both have cratered, and pilots are flying nearly empty jets around the United States and Europe. According to Aireon, a satellite-based aviation tracking company, 37,826 aircraft were tracked on Nov. 5, before the coronavirus took its toll on international air travel. On Tuesday, however, just 26,217 planes were detected, a decrease of 30.7 percent.   Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThese two Tuesdays, which would otherwise show comparable flight totals, demonstrate the acute impact of the covid-19 crisis on the aviation industry,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Cyriel Kronenburg, vice president of aviation services at Aireon.   [Inside DeltaÃ¢\\x80\\x99s command center the week the coronavirus devastated the airline industry]   Flight crews now often have eerily quiet airports to themselves. One longtime flight attendant for Alaska Airlines said the industry crisis is worse than the downturn after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when her husband, a pilot for Alaska Air, was flying.   They worry about losing their jobs, said the attendant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to discuss the business. And they Ã¢\\x80\\x9care both terrified of us getting sick on the roadÃ¢\\x80\\x9d and bringing the coronavirus home to their children, she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a fear every time I go to work.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d   Furloughs and layoffs and anxiety ripple throughout an industry that employs 750,000 in the United States alone.   Jon Weaks, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, said the rapid descent of industry fortunes has been stunning.   Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI think the shock to everyone is the speed of change from when it had been talked about in the world, to within a matter of days,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d when everything was canceled, he said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t a crisis until it was, and when it was, man, it was full on.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d   Just a few weeks ago, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), a trade group of nearly 300 airlines worldwide, offered a grim projection: Revenue would decline by $113 billion in 2020. Then the United States imposed travel restrictions on 28 European nations, and IATA revised its projection.   Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOur previous worst-case scenarioÃ¢\\x80\\x9d from mid-March, said Alexandre de Juniac, director general and chief executive of IATA, now looks far greater than the latest estimates, which forecast revenue plummeting by $252 billion.   Recovery may not come until 2021, the associationÃ¢\\x80\\x99s chief economist said Tuesday during a conference call.   Many airlines are operating flights that are only 20 or 30 percent full, despite significant cuts in service, and IATA estimates that 1.1 million flights will be canceled through June 30.   Before the coronavirus outbreak, U.S. carriers were transporting record numbers of passengers Ã¢\\x80\\x94 about 2.5 million daily. The numbers had climbed for 28 months, and in January, 61.2 million passengers flew domestically, and 9.1 million internationally.  2.5 million passenger  screenings 2.1M 2019 2.0 Trump declares national emergency 1.5 2020 The covid-19  outbreak caused a sharp drop in  travel from  U.S. airports 1.0 State Department warns against world travel 0.5 146K 0 March 1 7 13 19 24 31 Source: Transportation Security Administration 2.5 million passenger  screenings 2.1M 2019 2.0 Trump declares national emergency 1.5 2020 The covid-19 outbreak  caused a sharp drop  in travel from  U.S. airports 1.0 State Department warns against world travel 0.5 146K 0 March 1 7 13 19 24 31 Source: Transportation Security Administration 2.5 million passenger screenings 2.4M 2019 2.0 Trump declares national emergency 1.5 The covid-19 outbreak  caused a sharp drop  in travel from U.S. airports 2020 1.0 State Department warns against world travel 0.5 146K 0 March 1 March 7 March 13 March 19 March 24 March 31 Source: Transportation Security Administration  Then the bottom fell out.   On Tuesday, the TSA screened just over 146,000 passengers at U.S. airports, a 94 percent plunge from 2.4 million on the same day last year. By the end of March, the TSA screened just over 35 million passengers at U.S. airports during the month, a 50 percent decrease from more than 70 million at the end of March last year.   The $2.2 trillion economic recovery bill that President Trump signed into law will temporarily prevent mass layoffs and furloughs at major domestic airlines, said Sara Nelson, the international president of the Association of Flight Attendants, which lobbied Congress to pass the legislation.   But that doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t put travelers in the seats.   With 250 million Americans under stay-at-home orders, pilots are on a new assignment: set the birds down to park at far-flung airports. The first to go were the widebody jumbo jets, particularly any relatively old and inefficient models, such as the Boeing 747 and the Airbus A340.   Last weekend, Qantas and KLM operated what probably will be their last scheduled 747 flights Ã¢\\x80\\x94 a model that KLM had operated for 49 years and planned to retire in 2021.   American is accelerating the retirement of its once ubiquitous Boeing 767 and 757s; Delta Air Lines is planning the same for its McDonnell Douglas MD-88s and MD-90s. Retiring these older models can save the airlines money as they focus on operating with newer, more efficient jets.   But Delta is also parking efficient, smaller jets, including its Boeing 717 fleet, and newer long-haul planes, such as the Airbus A350, as it downsizes to try to weather the industry storm.   And many pilots worry that entire aircraft types will be retired, leaving their careers in limbo.  View from above: In recent days, satellites have captured newly parked planes at airports worldwide. Satellite images via Planet Labs (Birmingham Airport in Alabama; Pinal Airpark in Arizona; Roswell, N.M.; Tulsa Airport; Victorville, Calif.) and Maxar Technologies (Mobile, Ariz.; Copenhagen Airport; Charles de Gaulle Airport in France; Frankfurt Airport in Germany; Denver)  Finding enough parking spaces requires creativity.   In Copenhagen, airport authorities are closing taxiways to house some of the Scandinavian Airlines fleet. Lufthansa is using a new airport in Berlin that hasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t opened yet and a runway in Frankfurt. American Airlines is putting planes in the parking lot at its maintenance facility in Tulsa as it and other airlines fly their fleets to storage in Mobile and Birmingham in Alabama and Roswell, N.M.   View from the ground: To limit the spread of the coronavirus, U.S. and international carriers are significantly reducing flights, and some planes may never return to service.

Franklin/AP; Etienne Laurent/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock; Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters; Martin Sylvest/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)   Eric Jordan hopes all this chaos is temporary. The longtime pilot with a major U.S. airline has navigated all kinds of downturns, mergers and bankruptcies and thinks the airlines will bounce back once the pandemic subsides. The massive $2.2 trillion stimulus bill, with about $50 billion earmarked for the industry, is intended to help.   For now, heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not sure heÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll get back up in the air before May, at the soonest.   ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s worse for the rising class of pilots in the pipeline, waiting to go from regional airlines to the so-called majors, such as Delta and American, Jordan said. TheyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re in limbo.   Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI feel for these guys, these younger guys,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said.   And although a Ã¢\\x80\\x9ctsunami wave of pilot retirementsÃ¢\\x80\\x9d and buyouts may make way for others, and blunt some need for furloughs and layoffs, Ã¢\\x80\\x9clast hired, first firedÃ¢\\x80\\x9d still applies to those at the bottom of the ladder, said Dennis Tajer, a Boeing 737 captain and spokesman for the labor union that represents American Airlines pilots.   Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat makes this time different than other shocks to the system,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, is the number of pilots Ã¢\\x80\\x9con the cusp of having to retire, thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s actually going to help.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d   More than 600 American Airlines pilots close to retirement age took a Ã¢\\x80\\x9cvoluntary permanent leave of absenceÃ¢\\x80\\x9d the airline offered to stave off furloughs and layoffs, at least for the time being. Those pilots will receive 50 hours of pay per month through age 65 and keep their benefits. Although the offer was attractive to many, social media accounts last weekend were full of posts from pilots who didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t get to fly their last flight, which typically involves a firetruck water hose salute after landing.   Instead, they went from thinking retirement was months or years away to suddenly handing in their wings.   The unexpected shift and uncertainty is especially problematic for pilots, Tajer said.   Their profession requires and rewards certitude, which is derived from experience as well as precision, procedures and processes. And it attracts men and women who crave that.   Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWe may be unique in the license that we carry and the training we have,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Tajer said of the upheaval. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re not unique to the human experience.\"   Lori Aratani and Michael Laris contributed to this report. Editing by Ann Gerhart.

The death toll from covid-19 began to rise steadily in early March, then more sharply as the disease spread to every state and most U.S. territories.   Since the coronavirus outbreak began in China, new cases have been confirmed on every continent except Antarctica and in more than 170 countries.  Most Read Follow Post Graphics ',\n",
